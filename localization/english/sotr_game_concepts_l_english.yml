These massive volumes of Books are the ultimate repositories of invaluable knowledge—each one a culmination of generations of study, experimentation, and verified thesis within a field of study. \n\nEvery sentence inscribed within them has been researched, tested, peer-reviewed, and etched through countless lifetimes of collective intellect.\n\nDwemer clans have waged wars over the loss of a single page—willing to sacrifice lives to protect or possess even the smallest fragment.\n\nEach tome is safeguarded beyond all measure, often hidden within high security vaults, sealed by riddles and tones only known to the highest minds of a clan. The Ultimate Tomes are the crowning fruits of the Dwemers eternal pursuit of truth and understanding."

Each face of the cube pulses with breathtaking imageries and strange cosmic anomalies throughout the Universe—  glimpses of things that no naked eyes were ever meant to perceive.\n\nThe secrets of their creation or what they reflect are guarded fiercely by the Dwemer clans that possess them, passed down secretly to their members. To each clan, a Mirage Cube is more than an heirloom—it is a source of their identity, pride, and knowledge. It embodies the Dwemer's unyielding curiosity and relentless pursuit of the unknowable."

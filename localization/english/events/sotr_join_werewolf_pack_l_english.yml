Every heartbeat is a thunderclap in your skull, every breath a ragged fight against the crushing weight in your chest.\n\nFire and ice flood your veins at once, the agony drowning out thought. Your legs buckle, claws scraping at the earth as the world spins and darkens.\n\nWith one last, shuddering breath, your body gives way. The last thing you hear is the low, rumbling growl of the Pack Alpha—neither mourning nor mocking, but claiming what is left of you."

The frail human shell you once carried feels meaningless—a skin you can now cast aside or wear as you please.\n\nYou draw a breath and the world blooms in scent and sound—every heartbeat, every rustle of leaves, every drop of rain singing in perfect clarity. Strength surges through every muscle, ready to unleash at your command.\n\nYou lower your head to the Alpha who has remade you. Their faith will not be wasted—you will hunt, fight, and lead in their name."

Though not as mighty as the Ysgramor himself, they were no less ruthless...\n\nNow their families stand before you, eyes wide with fear, yet carrying the same hardened gaze of your fallen foe. The tide of vengeance swells once more. Will you wipe the bloodline of [recipient.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] from the world, or let them live to bear the weight of your mercy?"

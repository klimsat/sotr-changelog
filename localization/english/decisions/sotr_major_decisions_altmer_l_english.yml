It has long remained in the hands of High Aldmeri overlords. Maybe that's about to change soon. \n\n But only way to claim the Tower is  either through War or Gold. You can wage a costly and risky war against the Aldmeri overlords, risking everything to seize it by force. \n\nOr, you can amass a fortune and buy your way into ownership, though the price will be nothing short of extravagant."

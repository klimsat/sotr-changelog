He was the spiritual leader of a dissident movement that shaped an entirely new elven culture and identity.\n\nVeloth rejected the values of Aldmeri society, which he considered to be constricted by rigid castes & blood purity. He spoke to those disillusioned with the established order, offering a vision of a more just and honest way of life. His teachings were set down in the Velothi Prophecies, which turned away from traditional Aedra-worship and instead upheld Boethiah, Azura, and Mephala as the “Good Daedra.”\n\nVeloth’s movement grew quickly as more clans joined his cause, drawing swift retribution from the Aldmeri elite. Condemned and harassed within Summerset, he and his followers eventually set forth on a mass migration to mainland Tamriel—a journey later known as the Great Exodus.\n\nTrinimac, the Champion of Auri-El, opposed and halted the exodus, but he was said to be defeated by the Daedric Prince Boethiah, whose triumph secured Veloth’s path forward.\n\nThough the journey was long and harsh, Veloth’s leadership bound his people together, uniting them through shared faith and purpose. From this exodus the foundations of Resdayn were laid, and Veloth would forever be known as the spiritual father of the Chimeri People."

 # Unsettling news are coming from up North
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0001.t:0 "Unseettling News..."
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0001.desc:0 "Disturbing news continues to emerge from Atmora.\n\nAs the newly established settlements in Mereth flourish, increasing numbers of Atmorans continue to abandon their ancestral homeland, drawn southward by the promise of better lands and brighter sky. \n\nHowever, not all are pleased with this shift. Subtle murmurs speak of growing unease among the Dragon Priests, whose silence veils a simmering discontent. Even the World-Eater Himself is said to stir, displeased by the dwindling numbers of the faithful who still offer worship to the dragons."

 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0001.a:0 "Damn those Masked Zealots to Oblivion."
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0001.a.tt:0 "If they dare set foot in Mereth, I’ll gladly introduce them to my steel."
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0001.b:0 "Let them come."
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0001.b.tt:0 "If they dare assault us, we’ll stack their bones like firewood on Mereth’s shores"
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0001.c:0 "Worry not, for [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] is with us."
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0001.c.tt:0 "We remain, as we must, to preserve our faith and we shall await the trials in the days to come."
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0001.d:0 "Let me write down my surrender letter before they arrive."
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0001.d.tt:0 "This talk of Dragon Priests and the World-Eater makes my blood run cold. Perhaps it's best we keep our heads down...and speak of something else..."
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0001.e:0 "Let us hope for the best resolution"
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0001.e.tt:0 "The dragons may come with fire, but we'll meet them with open hands—and maybe a strong ale to share."
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0001.f:0 "It's about time that the heathens are judged."
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0001.f.tt:0 "Faith has withered in the hearts of men, and now they shall reap the consequences. Let us await the fires that will cleanse the unfaithful."
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0001.g:0 "We must prepare ourselves. There might be hardship ahead."
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0001.g.tt:0 "If they come with war, we'll be ready. If they come with words, we'll listen."

  # A Dragon Priest is attacked
  dragon_holy_war_beginning.0002.t:0 "About the Dragon Priest..."
  dragon_holy_war_beginning.0002.desc:1 "Today, it felt as though even the mountains held their breath. \n\nFor many years, the Companions had permitted the Dragon Cultists to remain—allowing them to preach their faith, grant blessings, and spoke of their Lord's favor. Though many regarded their kind with suspicion, the Atmoran chieftains, mindful of the Dragons' aid during the Conquest, chose to tolerate their presence.\n\nBut now, a heavy silence has fallen, and the air hangs thick with unease. A Dragon Priest has been publicly assaulted within Mereth—the dragon temple was seized and their authority was openly defied. Though there has been no immediate response, all know what such an act portends. \n\nThe rest of the Dragon Priests, along with their Master have yet to react in light of this. \n\n#TUT .......But for how long?#!"

 
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0002.a:0 "Let them choke on it."
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0002.a.flavor:0 "If their pride is wounded, let them come swinging. We’ll send their bones back wrapped in dragonhide."
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0002.a.tt:0 "@warning_icon! #negative_value This message may provoke the Dragon Priests#!"
 
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0002.b:0 "A necessary provocation."
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0002.b.flavor:0 "Let them awaken. We’ve sharpened our blades and buried our fear."
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0002.b.tt:0 "@warning_icon! #negative_value This message may provoke the Dragon Priests#!"

 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0002.c:0 "Good. It should have happened sooner."
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0002.c.flavor:0 "Let their kind bleed. The Totems do not suffer masks and lies—we were right to cast the first stone. If the dragons come, they’ll find no fear in us."
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0002.c.tt:0 "@warning_icon! #negative_value This message may provoke the Dragon Priests#!"

 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0002.d:0 "Maybe if we just stay very quiet..."
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0002.d.flavor:0 "Let's just hope that they might forget we exist. If they do, I’m not volunteering for any battles, that’s for sure."
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0002.d.tt:0 "....."
 
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0002.e:0 "Perhaps they will understand this misunderstanding."
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0002.e.flavor:0 "Unlikely as it is, we can always hope the mask hides a sense of humor and understand that it's not meant as an offence. Let's just hope for the best."
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0002.e.tt:0 "....."


 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0002.f:0 "Let's just keep our eyes open."
 dragon_holy_war_beginning.0002.f.flavor:0 "A Dragon Priest expelled... We shall see what follows. For now, let us be watchful."

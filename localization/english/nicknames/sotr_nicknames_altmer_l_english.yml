 nick_the_sload_of_alinor:0 "the Sload-King of Alinor"
 nick_the_sload_of_alinor_desc:1 "At his birth, Elven nobles from Lillandril all the way to Heartlands flocked to Alinor to pay homage, bearing lavish tributes and extolling praises for the newest member of the High Elven Royal Family. The newborn prince awed all who beheld him, for he was the very embodiment of elven grace—pure-blooded, radiant, and brimful of promise.\n\nHe grew into a dashing young prince whose very presence could make any Mer flush with admiration. Well-learned and shrewd, he easily passed the Altmeri Regal Praxis and was firmly set to inherit the Ceremoniarchy. So magnificent was his bearing that he was bestowed the title “Gold-Prince of Alinor.”\n\nAs time passed, the unwavering attention he garnered would eventually fanned the flames of his vanity. He exploited both his looks and his family name, seducing every fair maiden within his sight, heedless of tradition or the Praxis. \n\nHis reign was, beyond all doubt, the grandest display of excess Summerset had ever seen. He continues to gratify his hedonistic desires — lavish revels, exquisite wines, and the constant company of elven maidens.\n\nCenturies of unbridled excess transformed the once-beautiful prince into a grotesque parody of his former self. He became the heaviest monarch ever to ascend the Throne of Alinor, all existing armors in the palace strained at his bulk, and even his bed frames had to be reforged with ebony steel to support his weight. His reign was marked by ostentatious and unnecessary expenditures, the palace corridors echoing with the laughter of his many mistresses.\n\nThe very title he had borne as a Prince had slowly curdled into a mockery. Though none dared speak it to his face while he lived, in the end —the once-venerated “Gold-Prince of Alinor” came to be remembered across the isles as the #bold Sload-King of Alinor. #!"

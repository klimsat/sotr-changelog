  nick_bare_breeches_desc:1 "During a great hunt in the mighty forests of Grahtwood, a veracious prey led [CharYouHerHim(CHARACTER)] on a chase through thorn and thicket. While on the chase, [CharYourHerHis(CHARACTER)] skin was etched and [CharYourHerHis(CHARACTER)] leathers were shredded. \n\n [CharYourHerHis(CHARACTER)|U] breeches fell in tatters, but [CharYouSheHe(CHARACTER)] insists that the hunt must go on. [CharYouSheHe(CHARACTER)|U] would cast aside the trappings of cloth and strode like the beasts of the wild. Bare, unburdened, with nothing but [CharYourHerHis(CHARACTER)] weapon and resolve, [CharYouSheHe(CHARACTER)] just ran through roots and rivers in a relentless pursuit. \n\n When the hunt came to an end, [CharYouSheHe(CHARACTER)] returned to [CharYourHerHis(CHARACTER)] home, covered with nothing but blood and Victory. In that defining moment, [CharYouSheHe(CHARACTER)] earned the moniker 'Bare-Breeches', a name that reflects the untamed spirit of [CharYourHerHis(CHARACTER)] wild heart."

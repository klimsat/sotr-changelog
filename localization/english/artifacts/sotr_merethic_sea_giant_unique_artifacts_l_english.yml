  artifact_thumul_sunken_titan_description:1 "Sunken Titan is the colossal club wielded by Thumul, the legendary Sea Giant of the deep. Towering and awe-inspiring, it might be the biggest melee weapon any men or elves would ever lay their eyes upon. \n\nForged from an unknown green metal found only in the lightless depths of the sea, the club is carved in the likeness of the terrors of the deep, with sculpted tentacles forming the jagged ridges and barbed spikes along its surface.\n\nThe waters of the sea have rinsed the blood of countless men from its surface, as well as their strewn shattered bones. The rusted metal still echoes with the agony of its many writhing foes."

  artifact_uldor_staff_description:1 "The staff is a dark, imposing relic—carved from ebony into the coiling shape of a sea serpent, its sinuous body winding upward toward a gleaming Aeonstone crystal set at its crown. The serpent’s head appears to phase through the glowing gem, which pulses faintly with an eerie green light. Wielded by the dreaded Maormer necromancer [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'maormer_khenarthi_uldor_merethic_era' ).GetFirstName] of Khenarthi’s Roost, the staff has become a symbol of dread across the southern tides of Elsweyr."

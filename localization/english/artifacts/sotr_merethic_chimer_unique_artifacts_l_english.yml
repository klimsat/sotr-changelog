  veloths_judgement_merethic_description:1 "Veloth's Judgment, also called the Judgment of Saint Veloth, is the legendary warhammer wielded by [Glossary('Saint Veloth', 'SAINT_VELOTH_GLOSS')] during the Chimer exodus from Summerset. More than a weapon, it embodied Veloth’s will — to cleanse the wicked, protect the faithful, and deliver justice when words could do no more.\n\nEnchanted with rare power, the hammer could strip corruption from a soul without destroying the body, leaving the redeemed alive and whole. That stolen corruption was stored within the weapon, turned into energy that amplified its strength with each blow. \n\nThough mighty in battle, Veloth eventually set the warhammer aside when he chose the path of peace, devoting himself to the founding of a new home for his people in Resdayn."

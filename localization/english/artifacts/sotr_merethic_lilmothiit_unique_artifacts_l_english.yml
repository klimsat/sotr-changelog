  artifact_hans_the_fox_helmet_description:1 "The Helmet of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'adventurer_lilmothiit_hans_1_merethic_era' ).GetFirstName] the Fox is a formidable piece of Lilmothiit wargear, designed not for subtlety, but for survival against the savage threats of the deep marshes. Forged from dark, weathered steel, its visor juts forward in the shape of a fox’s muzzle, crafted to deflect claws, fangs, and crude blades with brutal efficiency.\n\nAt the helm’s centre sits a gleaming carnelian gem that shines with a deep red gleam. The gem itself is said to symbolize something which is dear to Han's heart. \n\nThough heavy and battle-scarred, the helmet was renowned for its balance and protection, allowing Hans to fight with relentless aggression amid the monstrous frontiers where steel alone was often the thin line between life and oblivion."

Its shaft, carved from dense swamp-ironwood, is wrapped in sinew for grip and etched with flowing vine motifs that echo the tangled wetlands Hans called home. \n\nThe broad, fang-shaped ebony spearhead is designed to pierce hides and scales with ridiculous ease. Though deadly in battle, the spear also served as Hans’ hiking staff, steadying his steps through the wilderness."

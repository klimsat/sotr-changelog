Grief gripped his heart—for the kin he could not save and for the home he lost. As thunder roared in the heavens and sorrow weighed upon his heart, Ysgramor's tears, by wonders unseen— crystallized into veins of pure ebony.\n\nFollowing this miraculous event, the grief-stricken [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'companion_yngol_merethic_era' ).GetFirstName] picked up the ebony and meticulously tried to create something out of his father's tears. He tempered them by harnessing the storm's lightning, then quenched them in the very waters of the sea, and the result was a legendary axe forged from Ysgramor's own sorrow. Yngol gifted the axe to his father, who named it "Wuuthrad," meaning "Storm's Tears" in the Atmoran tongue\n\nRunes of strange magic pulse along its ebony core, drinking deep the blood of those dare stand against it. The axe's cry, as it strikes, is said to echo with the fury of the gods, a testament to the grief and wrath of Ysgramor and his son Yngol. Wuuthrad is not just any weapon; it is the legacy of the Companions, a reminder to all that the storm will come to those dare face the 'Childrens of the Sky'"

Her ferocious roar was the last sound the Companions heard before the snow ran red with her blood, and her passing was mourned as deeply as that of any companion in arms. \n\nIn the eyes of Vikord and the other Companions, Bjorga had earned her place among the 500.

Its broad horns sweep outward in the proud, brutal fashion of the northern clans—unmistakably Atmoran. The surface is dark as midnight, dulled not by wear but by purpose, much like the man himself. \n\nHarrald is said to never part with it—he wears it to war, while he sleeps, and even as he wages battle beneath the furs. But when drinking time comes, the helm comes off. All Atmorans know that no one can swill mead properly in a helmet—not even Harrald"

Each edge is battered and notched, yet all the deadlier for it, biting through helms and bone with the same blunt finality. The haft is wrapped in dark leather, slick with the sweat of countless battles, and carved with coarse knotwork—more for grip than for show. It radiates a palpable aura of brute force, as though each swing echoes with the roars of the old Atmoran warbands.\n\nFor all its weight, Harrald wields it as easily as one lifts a drinking horn. Subtlety is a stranger to this weapon. It was made for breaking, for bludgeoning, and for settling disputes in the only tongue Harrald truly trusts—iron against skull."

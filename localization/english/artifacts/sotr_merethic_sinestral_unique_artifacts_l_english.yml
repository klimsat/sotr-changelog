  artifact_sinestral_high_crown_description:1 "Forged from solid gold, the Crown of the Sinestral High King takes the form of a grand halo, encircling the head in a sunburst of straight, gleaming rays. It offers no comfort to it's wearer, only presence. \n\nDangling from its sides are red rubies, swaying like drops of blood. For the Sinestral Elves, who believe there is nothing beyond death, the crown is not a symbol of divinity or grace—it is a warning. Rule while you can, and show them your prestige and might."

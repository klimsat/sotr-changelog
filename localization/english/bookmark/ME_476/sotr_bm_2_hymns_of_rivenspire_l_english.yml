  bm_hymns_of_rivenspire_desc:0 "From the jagged peaks of the Doomcrag to the storm-lashed cliffs where the Sea of Ghosts claws at the northern shores, Rivenspire broods in solemn silence. Towering, flinty crags tear at the skies, while narrow canyons and windswept moors whisper with secrets best left buried.\n\nAmong the native people of High Rock dwell the Galenfolk—one of the oldest Nedic Cultures in the continent. Some follow the Green gods of druidic faith, while others whisper to the Forgotten Ones, deities erased from stone but not from memory. Ritual fires burn on the moors, and offerings of blood and bone are left beneath standing stones no sane traveler would approach.\n\nBut faith offers little protection from the darkness that grips the land. Ancient Balfieri masters rule from crumbling manors with velvet grace and arcane mastery. Orcish warbands roam the high passes, carving their own brutal domains, while witches of exiles delve into long-abandoned spires in search of forbidden lore.\n\nThe region is littered with the scars of unnumbered atrocities—forts haunted by the restless dead, valleys poisoned by ancient spells, and a coastline plagued by ghost-fogs that drag the living into the sea’s icy embrace. \n\n#bold Will you brave the cursed beauty of Rivenspire and carve a new destiny from its haunted stones? Or will your name become just another verse in the Hymns of Rivenspire?#"
  bm_balfieri_crebain:0 "High Kinlord Velyn Crebain"
  bm_balfieri_crebain_desc:0 "#bold #color_dark_gray Crebain oculum Corvi non Eruit#! #!\n\n'A Raven Will Not Pluck out a Crow’s Eye'\n\nHigh Kinlord #bold Velyn#! Crebain rules from the somber, hollow bastion of Ravenwatch — a keep veiled in shadow and silence, where whispers carry farther than banners and secrets cling to every stone. Clan Crebain is a name spoken in low tones and with wary glances among the Elves. \n\nDark-haired and darker still in reputation, they are the literal black sheep of the ancient Balfieri bloodlines—a family regarded with the least respect among the other Elven High Lords.\n\nUnlike the Aldvea Clan with their mighty fleets, the Adarielle's with their beauty, the Fyleare's with their verdant lands, or the Direnni's with their magical feats & glittering legacies. Clan Crebain’s reputation was largely shaped by rumors of their blasphemous practices.\n\nRumors cling to the Crebain like sea-mist to their cliffs: tales of binding circles beneath moonless skies, ravens that speak in tongues, and blood pacts made with sinister beings. \n\nYet beneath the shadow lies a truth few care to see—an unshaken, absolute veneration for loyalty that once truly defines Clan Crebain. The Crebains never forget a bond of goodwill, nor will they ever abandon their own.\n\nVelyn, for all his grim bearing and veiled words, seeks to cleanse his Clan of its maligned legacy. But the path to vindication is no easy path, especially when the world would rather remember a scandal than the truth.\n\n#bold Will you guide Velyn Crebain as he lifts his house from the depths? Or will the raven once more be mistaken for a bad omen?#"
  bm_galen_aine:0 "Aine the 'Iron-Vein'"
  bm_galen_aine_desc:0 "In the northernmost parts of Rivenspire, where frost clings to the rocks and the wind carries the dirges of forgotten gods, High Chieftain #bold Aine#! stands resolute. Called the Iron-Vein by both kinsman and foe, his blood runs cold with conviction, and his will is said to be harder than the roots of the mountain crags he calls home.\n\nThe old gods that once ruled the hearts of Nedes of the North, before the Magical star-gods, and the wretched Galen make them turned their backs on blood-stone rites and ancient-oaths. \n\nAfter being driven northward by their own kin, the dwindling remnants of the Old Way have found its final refuge in Aine’s holdings, where bonfires still burn for nameless spirits and ancestral rites echo under starlit skies.\n\nBut now, the tide rises again—this time not only from their own people. From the shadows emerged the Enclave Clan, a brutal, bloodthirsty tribe of Orcs intent on crushing the last bastion of his people. \n\nTheir menace is undeniable, yet the orcs pale in comparison to the greater threat that looms beyond. The Balfieri overlords, cloaked in elven grace and ancient pride, press ever closer—pushing the Galenfolk further into the seas, and branding people like 'the Iron-Vein' as remnants of a savage and bygone age. \n\nYet relics do not bleed. Just as when steel meets snow, Aine does not bend. Winter has tried to break him. War has tried to bury him. But neither could claim him. He endures — unyielding and ever watchful.\n\n#bold Will you stand with Aine in defense of the Forgotten Gods, or will his proud legacy be extinguished by time and tyranny?#"
  bm_galen_kedis:0 "Kedis, Daughter of the Green"
  bm_galen_kedis_desc:0 "Amid the whispering hollows of Rivenspire, walks #bold Kedis#!—flame-haired and resolute, a daughter of the long-line of druids and faithful devotees to Y’ffre. The birds follow her path and the trees bend gently as she passes, for the wilds know her name.\n\nRaised among the Circle of Thorns, Kedis was trained not only in the rites of Y’ffre, but in the on how to sustain balance—between elf and man, beast and bloom, storm and seed. \n\nShe emerged as one of the Galenfolks most compelling voices, not through force of arms, but through an unshakable harmony with the land and the spirit it breathes.\n\nWhere others stands like a cliff before the sea, Kedis flows like water—seeking to mend the wounds of division, trying to remind all Galenfolk that they are one people, born from the same soil, even if they now kneel to different gods.\n\nShe does not seek war, but neither does she shy from it. Her banners bears thorns, and her words carry storms. For though her heart seeks peace, she knows the forest must sometimes burn before it can bloom anew.\n\n#bold Will you guide Kedis to unite the fractured clans of Galen under the harmony of the Green? Or will her dream be swallowed by the rising tides of blood and ash?#"
  bm_galen_saraga:0 "Saraga"
  bm_galen_saraga_desc:0 "In the shadows of the Doomcrag, where mists seep through broken ruins, dwells the infamous witch #bold Saraga#!. Born beneath an ill-favored moon, her fate was cursed from the start. \n\nThe Men of Galen executed her mother for consorting with Mephala, leaving the young child orphaned. She was then raised by a group of Witches in the hollows beneath the Ravenwatch Hills, who taught her all manners of forbidden Dark arts.\n\nShe absorbed all forms of forbidden arts as if they were her native tongue, weaving spells of shadow and venom until her power eclipsed even those who had raised her. In time, she ascended to become the leader of their dark sisterhood. \n\nPatient and calculating, she has not forgotten the flames that consumed her mother. Now she lingers above Galen, weaving her webs in silence, waiting for the day when its people stumble into her grasp.\n\n#bold Will Saraga rise from the shadows of Rivenspire to spin her own dominion? Or will her web unravel beneath the weight of greater powers?#"
  bm_orc_enclave:0 "Chieftain Morlak of the Enclave"
  bm_orc_enclave_desc:0 "From the frozen passes of Wrothgar to the broken heights of Rivenspire, the banners of the Enclave Clan have become a rising symbol of fear and power. Guided not by fury alone, but by the quiet calculation of their chieftain—#bold Morlak gro-Lugorr#!.\n\nThe world still considers the Orc as nothing more than a bunch of mindless beasts, pariahs, and tools for squabbling lords. But Morlak envisions something greater.\n\nHe yearns for a homeland carved by orcish hands, ruled by orcish law, where no child must ever bow to foreign steel again.\n\nThe ghosts of Rivenspire whisper, warning of the land’s cursed past. But Morlak listens only to the future. He has no time for nonsensical superstitions—for he has an immense ambition to pursue.\n\n#bold Will you guide Morlak in forging his dream kingdom beneath the shadow of the Doomcrag? Or will this dream be fulfilled elsewhere?#"

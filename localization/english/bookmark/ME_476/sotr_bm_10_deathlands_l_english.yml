  #10 The Deathlands
  bm_deathlands:0 "The Deathlands"
  bm_deathlands_desc:0 "The desolate wasteland to the west of Tamriel was known only by its cursed name—the Deathlands. A vast and sun-scorched expanse of jagged stone, blistering heat, and endless sandstorms, it is a land where mercy is as rare as water.\n\nUp in the northern mountains, the Great Duraki people carve their strongholds throughout Craglorn, their kingdoms brimming with ancestral pride and unyielding honor. Beside them dwell the Iron Orcs—crafty, diligent, and masters of forge and stone. Their halls ring with hammers and firelight, and their craftsmanship are whispered of even in distant lands. \n\nIn the deep deserts and craggy canyons, the Keptus endure beneath the unrelenting sun—whispering with the wind and carving homes from sun-bleached cliffs. Elsewhere, Desert Orcs guard their hidden oases with ruthless tenacity, while Goblin tribes continue to stalk the badlands, striving to survive against their much bigger adversaries.\n\nHardly anyone seeks to claim these lands, and only a few dare to dream of taming them. Only the bold, the mad, or the damned would have the guts to call the Deathlands home.\n\n#bold Will you carve your legacy from blood and sand? or will the Deathlands claim your bones like all the rest?#"

To him, the endless slaughter between  the Ayleids over matters of faith is pure folly. There is absolutely no joy or benefit that comes when when he pierces a sword through his fellow Ayleids.\n\nWhile his fellow Aedraphile and Daedraphile kin tear each other apart, Xyloras sees a grander prize, a scorched and deadly waste to the west, ripe for conquest. Where others spill precious Ayleid blood, King Xyloras prefers to slay and subjugate the beasts that dwell within the untamed frontier.\n\n#bold Will you abandon the madness of the Schism and raise a new dominion amid the scorching wastes of the Deathlands?#!"

  bm_desert_orc_deathland_horde_desc:0 "The Desert Orcs came to the Deathlands to prove their worth as the truest devotees of Malacath. They chose this unforgiving land for its relentless cruelty, enduring it to be deemed worthy in #italic his#! sight...\n\nFrom the scorched sands of the Deathlands rises #bold Gorag gro-Lurgosh#! of the Red Horde. Through sheer brutality, Gorag embraced the relentless fury of the Deathlands, forging himself into a living embodiment of its savage spirit. None who challenge him ever live to tell the tale — and he would be very pleased to meet any of those who still dares.\n\nThe hordes of the Deathlands were once united under a single banner, before pride, ego, and the blood debts between tribes and chieftains broke it. \n\nNow, Gorag seeks to restore that unity and forge an empire tempered in blood and sand, unyielding before the fury of the desert. One that could withstand the blades of any enemies that may descend from any direction..\n\n#bold Will you unleash Gorag’s wrath and forge a lasting horde for the Desert Orcs?

Around him gather the great kings of Craglorn, whose courts shimmer with grandeur and prestige.

As old powers wane and new threats rise beyond the horizon, the fate of Craglorn — and perhaps all living humans in the Deathlands— rests on his shoulders.\n\n#bold Will you preserve the ancient legacy of the Duraki and guide Craglorn into a new golden age?#!"

  bm_goblin_bloodhorn_desc:0 "#bold Rhuk 'the Bloodhorn'#!  stands as the undisputed chief of his goblin tribe. Despite his oddly red skin, Rhuk proved himself again and again on the battlefield—each raid and triumph forged his reputation, and in time his name alone would strike terror into the enemy tribes and inspire fierce loyalty among his followers.\n\nThe goblins have dwelled in the Deathlands for as long as memory reaches—long before the orcs, the men, or even the elves. Yet through every age they have been scorned and trampled by their much bigger adversaries. Worse still, mistrust festers among themselves, and they spend their days locked in endless strife against each other.\n\nFrom the bloodied dunes of the Deathlands, Rhuk dreams of uniting the fractured goblin tribes into a single, unyielding nation. Beneath one banner, these once-scattered clans could march as one—swift, relentless, and decisive against all who dare oppose them.\n\n#bold Will you follow Rhuk the Bloodhorn, conquering the desert in his name and building an empire of goblins feared by all?#!"

  bm_dark_lullaby:0 "Merethic Lullabies"
  bm_dark_lullaby_desc:0 "In the twilight of the Merethic Era, as Elven dominion stretched across every sunlit land, a curse was born in shadows. Lamae Bal, once a priestess of Arkay, was defiled by Molag Bal. Her scream echoed through Nirn, heralding the rise of a dark and powerful kind,beings that would come to be known as #bold Vampires#!.\n\nSince that night, many mortals—driven by hunger, ambition, or devotion— followed her path to become one of the Children of the Night. Some begged the favor of Molag Bal, the Prince who started it all. Others gave their souls to the Blood-Cat Sanguine or whispered oaths in the dark to Clavicus Vile.\n\nNow, their numbers swell in the shadows. In High Rock's forgotten barrows, in Valenwood’s silent groves, in the ancient crags of Elsweyr and even in the remote deep jungles of Black Marsh. Vampire Lords descend to sing their lullabies— heralding their victims toward the gaze of the eternal night.\n\n#bold As the Merethic sun sets, who among the Blood Scions and Vampire Lords shall stand above them all and rise as the Ultimate Vampire King?#"

Once a noble of some forgotten Chimeri house, her name has long since slipped into myth, replaced by a hundred false faces and shifting forms. All who ever knew her knows that she is never what she seems.\n\nUnder her guidance, the Bathogorgen have slithered into the crags between Deshaan and Shadowfen, and they have become the nightmare to the people surrounding them. \n\nWhere others build legacies of stone and steel, Loranna writes hers in whispers and disappearing flames. Her motives remain unknowable—some say she serves Nocturnal, others that she dances only for herself—but her reach grows with every vanished rival and every frightened silence left in her wake.\n\n#bold Will Lady Loranna emerge from the shadows of illusion to claim Shadowfen, or vanish once more into sparks on the wind?#"

  bm_vampire_lady_bonsamu_desc:0 "Among the winding roots of Valenwood, Lady #bold Sylsa#! moves with grace and quiet cunning. As matriarch of the [Glossary('Bonsamu Clan', 'VAMPIRE_COVEN_BONSAMU_GLOSS')], she wears her lovely smile and walks beneath the sun as if she were kin to the very trees. \n\nTo the local Wood Elves, she is a renowned healer, and a Treethane of good reputation. But behind her soft gaze lies something unsettling, kept as a secret through the ages..\n\nWhere other Vampire Lords command beasts or shadows, Sylsa commands trust. Her coven does not typically deal in violence. Instead, they wield familiarity—an embrace, a warm bowl, and kind words.\n\nThen, when the fire dims and only candlelight remains, their glamour fades. The Bonsamus would then quietly sip the blood of their sleeping victims. Their victims would awake the next morning, never realizing what had occurred.\n\nAs wars erupt across Tamriel, so too does the urban climate shift, and vampire territories move like storm clouds. From behind the shrubs, Sylsa watches and smiles, her fangs already sharpened. She is ready to defend her domain by any means necessary.\n\n#bold Will Lady Sylsa’s lies endure the night—or will her quiet hunt be drowned in open war?#"

Chosen by Lamae Bal herself, Elain and her family do not merely feed on flesh, but on the fear that coils in the hearts of mortals. \n\nYet despite of their dreaded reputation, Elain holds to the belief that living must be consumed in moderation and discreetion, for terror loses its edge when there is nothing left to fear.\n\nBut across the mountain passes, the Mountain-Talon Clan brings ruin. Savage and without restraint, they hunt all non-vampires without end. Their bloodlust threatens to strip the Reach bare, and Elain knows it is only a matter of time before their slaughter turns toward her territory. \n\nShe stands at a crossroads— face the Mountain-Talons with all Clan's power and ancient wisdom, or seek out forbidden strength that might drive them back forever—at any cost.\n\n#bold Will Lady Elain hold to her code, or become the nightmare needed to destroy a greater one?#"

Her every breath was bound to prayer and sacred duty, shared in solemn vow with her fellow priests, Lyrezi and Vraseth.\n\nYet just as Arkay turned his gaze from the young woman who gave her this curse, so too did he abandon Selenu in her darkest hour. She had poured her whole life into him—every prayer, every breath, every sleepless night... But the god to whom she gave everything gave her nothing in return.\n\nSelenu was broken & fell into despair. The weight of betrayal had crushed all that she had been. From that ruin however, someone new emerged. \n\nCasting off Arkay’s chains, Lady Selenu embraced her newfound strength and turned her faith inward, vowing to test the limits of her body, her spirit, and her hunger. She wandered from place to place, seeking trials that might sate the restless power within her.\n\nOut of all the places she has wandered thus far, none have offered trials as unforgiving or as true as the scorched wastes of the Deathlands.\n\nAmong the unforgiving dunes and jagged cliffs, she would feed on the warring Orcs, Goblins, Durakis, Keptus, and—when the moons are right—even the Ayleid holdouts by shores.\n\nShe dwells in a place where every step leaves her at a disadvantage—yet none of its denizens have proven worthy thus far. In a land that devours the unworthy, she endures as a living myth, a predator whose domain stretches across the sun-scorched dunes.\n\n#bold Will the Lady of the wastes continue her search in the Deathlands, or will her thirst carry her beyond the dunes at last?#"

  bm_vampire_lord_diodata_desc:0 "On a small isle adrift in the Padomaic Ocean west of Resdayn, Lord #bold Tedhrum#! rules in shadow as the cunning master of the [Glossary('Diodata Clan', 'VAMPIRE_COVEN_DIODATA_GLOSS')]. Unlike the rest of the Dwemer, the members of the Diodata had turned from mere reason to revelation, abandoning the ways of the tonal logic to seek the dark truths in the unknown. \n\nThey seek them by any means necessary—even by serving beings they do not truly have faith in, feigning devotion where it suits their purpose. \n\nThey first tried to court Hermaeus Mora—the obvious choice, as they were drawn to his vast troves of hidden knowledge. But they found only riddles and very little to almost no secret. Frankly, they came to realize that the worthless prince had deceived them... gleaning more secrets from them than they ever did from him.\n\nAnd so they pressed on, always seeking the one who would give more than they took. One Prince after another disappointed them, until finally, Molag Bal answered.\n\nHe offered them everything they seek— power, immortality, infinite vision—in exchange for eternal service after death. The Diodatas accepted the offer, believing it to be a necessary bargain. For in their eyes, no price is too high in the pursuit of knowledge.\n\nThe Coven continued to thrive as a secretive network of spies, seers, and silent observers. Sleepless watchers in the shadows who speak through their thralls and wandering agents alike.\n\nBut not all who walk in darkness are allies. His Coven has long clashed with the savage [Glossary('Korgari', 'VAMPIRE_COVEN_KORGARI_GLOSS')]—a Chimeri bloodline driven not by reason, but by wrath and fury. Unlike other vampires, they cannot be vanquished by blade or spell... even the mightiest hammer of the Rourken could not bring them down. \n\nYet all know that every creature has a weakness, and for the Korgari, it is but a simple droplet of water. The Diodata have ensured they are surrounded by it. \n\nThe war endures, mind against muscle, water against fire. It is imperative that the Korgari be dealt with, for their flames could burn all that the Diodata have gathered and built.\n\n#bold You have kept your Clan safe in secrecy, but the time for observation may end. The Korgari must fall, or all you've seen shall be lost in blood and flame.#"

  bm_vampire_lord_korgari_desc:0 "Lord #bold Pyrel#! leads the [Glossary('Korgari Clan', 'VAMPIRE_COVEN_KORGARI_GLOSS')]—a fearsome Vampire coven bound to flame and fury. \n\nThe coven was first formed by a band of Ashlanders who turned from the Good Daedras to Molag Bal. They casted aside their pride and tradition for the favor of one of the Prince of Troubles. \n\nThe Prince agreed to grant them the power that they wished for, with a condition that the power they seek would come with a single flaw. Seeing no threat in one weakness, they agreed without hesitation.\n\nWhat they gained was terrifying. They became fire incarnate—walking infernos that seared everything they touched. Daylight could not harm them, and weapons passed through them as though they were nothing at all. They burned on as living fire bound in mortal form.\n\nBut what they had dismissed as trivial proved to be their undoing. The gift they accepted came with a cruel cost. What once gave life now brings only agony—for #bold Water #!, in any form, now burns their flesh like venom.\n\nPyrel had no idea the true cost of joining this Bloodline until it was far too late. In trading blood for power, he doomed his wife and children to a future soaked in fire and ash. The covenant with Molag Bal was no blessing—it was a betrayal dressed in strength. \n\nHis veins blaze with fury, yet all he can do is fight to keep his family stay in this world for as long as they can and chase the faint hope of a cure, if such mercy even exists.\n\nOn top of that, another burden weighs on him almost as heavily as the curse itself—the pesky [Glossary('Diodata Clan', 'VAMPIRE_COVEN_DIODATA_GLOSS')]. Ever-cowardly, they love to strike with stolen eyes and whispered schemes. Their feud is ancient, its beginning buried in dust and hate. \n\nPyrel did not event start this feud, yet they cling to old wounds and pester his kin like a bunch of flies. The Korgaris could have easily razed them from the world, if not for their distant island and cursed foresight. The Diodatas could see any blade before it falls—just enough to live, just enough to mock.\n\nBetween his cursed weakness, a conniving rival gnawing from the shadows, and the growing ambitions of both Chimeri and Dwemeri rulers across Resdayn, Lord Pyrel must now find a way to face them all.\n\n#bold You are fire made flesh. The Diodata hide, but fire reaches even the darkest corners. Burn their world, or be drowned in silence.#"

The cunning Elf was raised beneath the boughs of the Graht-Oaks, he grew up watching his parents chant Y’ffre’s name and perform countless rituals in his name. He listened, he obeyed and was fed according to the tradition of the Green Pact. \n\nBut as he grew, so did his hunger for something greater. Vargarion starts to think that if he was to feast on flesh for life, he might as well stop denying the powers that could come along with it.\n\nTo him, the Green Pact had become a leash—binding, blinding, hollow. And so, he became an apostate to his faith, and began to do the unthinkable. \n\nVargarion shows utter disrespect for the believers of the Green Pact by crafting dark artifacts from the roots and vines of a living Graht-Oak. Among the Bosmer, even harming a small sapling is heresy. To butcher a living Graht-Oak is one of the vilest sin imaginable. But where others saw sacrilege, Vargarion saw freedom.\n\nVargarion learned all manner of dark arts, eventually becoming a renowned master himself. He cast off Y’ffre entirely and turned to Molag Bal, who rewarded his devotion by blessing him to become a pure-blooded Vampire Lord.\n\nVargarion now leads a Vampire Coven called the Keerilth Clan. His dark coven stalks their prey beneath the roots, and even the bark recoils at their presence. Their name is cursed—and the trees weep as their power grows.\n\n#bold You are no longer prey to the Pact, but for how long?#"

Along the way, he met all manner of souls—many hearts he held close, and many he lost. Time and memory weighs heavy, and now, Lord Lyrezi seeks only a moment of silence. \n\nHis domain is a harsh, cold place, stalked by barbaric Riekrs and savage Orcish Clans. So far, none of these monsters have dared to bother him. They all know better than to disturb the deeper terror that sleeps within the mountains—an ancient horror who has faced countless mortals and monsters, and who now watches the world with his bright yet tired eyes.\n\n#bold Will the ancient Vampire remain dormant, or will the world rouse and disturb his slumber?#"

  bm_vampire_lord_vraseth_desc:0 "Lord #bold Vraseth#! of the [Glossary('Vraseth Coven', 'VAMPIRE_COVEN_VRASETH_GLOSS')] was one of the first three mortals ever to be blessed—or cursed—by Lamae Bal herself. \n\nThat night remains the most horrifying night of his long life. He still remembers the shivers that gripped him as hew saw the corpse of a young woman rose from the flames, her eyes burning with fury and anguish. \n\nBefore he could even grasp the horror unfolding before him, she had already torn into his fellow priest, Lyrezi, and the Elder Priest, Selenu. Driven by pure terror, Vraseth fled as fast as his legs could carry him.\n\nHe stopped and turned back to check on them, but all he saw were the corpses of his comrades and the roaring fire behind them. Dropping to his knees, he sighed in fleeting moment of relief, thinking he had escaped her wrath. \n\nBut as he made his way through the snowy pines in search of help, the young woman suddenly appeared in front of him. \n\nShe stood still in the snow, eerily beautiful—pale as moonlight, with crimson eyes glowing brighter than Masser itself. But before he could draw breath, her fangs were already in his throat. \n\nThat, he thought... was the end of him..... \n\nBut little did Vraseth know... that was only the beginning.\n\nVraseth was born to humble peasants among the snow-laden pines of Kreath. Small and frail, he grew up the runt of the tribe—bullied, bruised, and often mocked for his stature. \n\nThe constant torment left him fearful of nearly everything, yet even that cruelty paled in comparison to the land itself. Winters in the north were long and merciless, and life was short—unless mercy found you first.\n\nWith such humble origins and being nothing but a meekly weak priest, he never imagined he would survive a night like that. Yet he did—and nothing was ever the same again. \n\nAs he awoke with a strange sensation, he was surprised to hear the voices of his two fellow priests coming out of the pines. But when he turned to them, he saw something strange. \n\nAmid the veil of snows, their eyes glowed in the dark—bright, colorful, and hauntingly beautiful. As it turned out, the young woman had not killed them. She had turned them into something else entirely. Something unnatural… something powerful.\n\nThe change gifted Vraseth and his fellow priests with unimaginable abilities. He could move faster than any wild beast, strike harder than even the strongest giant, and sense things no living man could perceive. Shadows bent around him. His presence unsettled the air. A child once afraid of the world had become something it now feared in turn.\n\nIn time, Vraseth started his own vampire coven. He passed on his gift only to those who shared his vision—those who are quick of wit and the swift of body, precise in their kills and able to choose their battles carefully. Vraseth also favored those willing to leave all ties behind, for his restless spirit compelled him to wander across Tamriel, ever drawn onward by the promise of new blood and new horizons.\n\nAfter a millennium of wandering, Vraseth and his coven chose to settle in Glenumbra, a land filled with beings unlike any he had tasted. He had fed on all manner of men, beasts, elves, and even Daedras— though he swore never to do so again. But here, the blood of man and elf flowed as one, creating a new intriguing and intoxicating flavor.\n\nYet he knew better than to act without caution. The Balfieri High Lords are watching ever closely, their grip upon these lands firm and unrelenting. But if his dinner feasts were threatened, Lord Vraseth would also not hesitate to bare his fangs.\n\nHe is no longer the little meekly child of a little northern tribe. He is Lord Vraseth—patron of the Dreadful Vraseth Coven. An ancient Vampire whose name brings silence to the night, and whose children yearn for the blood of the living.\n\n#bold Will Lord Vraseth continue his hunt in the shadows of Glenumbra, or will his thirst lure him to great conflicts with the High Kinlords of Balfiera?#"

His is a reign not marked by banners or battles—but by silence, secrets, and shadows cast across the waves.\n\nCalen has kept his kin hidden upon their shrouded isle off the coast of Auridon, cloaking themselves from the wrath of the Welkynars as well as the High-handed Kinlords. \n\nUnder his Patronage, the Mairon Coven have refined their hidden abilities to perfection—becoming whispers that flit through fog, and wraiths that strike without trace.\n\nBut something stirs within the ranks of the Coven. A quiet, secret hunger gnaws at them all. Perhaps it is the pressure of centuries spent in hiding, or the fading strength of bloodlines that once rivaled the most ancient Covens of the mainland. Lord Calen begins to test the bounds of secrecy. Ships vanish farther from shore. The waters along the coasts of Summerset grow darker.\n\n#bold Will Lord Calen step from his sanctuary to bring the Mairon’s cold dominion upon Auridon—or will he vanish again beneath the mists, forgotten until the next whisper?#"

They descend upon the locals like brutal storms—terrorizing their prey, scattering blood, and leaving nothing but ruin behind. Their brutal conquests and uncontrolled bloodlust have made enemies of nearly every other vampire clan, who view the Mountain-Talons as a blight upon their kind.\n\nGolan considers them all pathetic for holding such a view.

It was said that Aldar can command obedience without uttering a single word, and those who dare cross him would find their lives shackled in ceaseless dread.\n\nOperating in the shadows as an elite assassin order, the Oio Serache mainly are employed by the Sorcerer-Kings who prefer their enemies erased without soiling their own hands. \n\nFor now, the Oio Serache dwells within Kingdom of Abagarlas, their sanctuary hidden deep within its borders.

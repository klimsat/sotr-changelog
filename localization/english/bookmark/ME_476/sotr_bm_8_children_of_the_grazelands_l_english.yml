   bm_children_of_the_grazelands:0 "Children of the Grazeland"
   bm_children_of_the_grazelands_desc:0 "In the waning light of the Merethic Era, the Grazelands of southern Resdayn bloom wild and untamed—verdant plains where the wind carries both promise and prophecy. But peace is a stranger here. Many lay claim to this land, each believing themselves deserving to rule it.\n\nThe Chimer come draped in trials and fate, guided by Prophet Veloth and the gods who once walked beside them. To some, the Grazelands are a promised realm where Veloth's children may root their faith into the earth. To others, it is simply a gameboard—where the powerful families scheme for wealth, power, and the favor of forgotten spirits.\n\nThe Dwemer build in silence, their citadels rising from the hills like buried thoughts made real. They seek not just land, but dominion over the secrets beneath it. The Grazelands are not sacred to them—only a vast area of unmeasured potential.\n\nThen there are the Rontha, a proud and fierce Nedic tribe, who remember when the wind once whispered their names aloud. With each passing moon, they are driven further from the Mountains and ember rivers that once cradled their birth.\n\n#bold As dawn breaks over ash and grass, will you carve your legacy into the land—or be trampled beneath the hooves of time?#"

   bm_ashlander_cubkhan_desc:0 "Despite how young he is, #bold Gnaar-vi#! of the Vereansu tribe is no ordinary child. Even in his young age, he has already earned a notorious reputation as a young ashkhan, feared by friend and foe alike.\n\nThe cub has yet to reach his prime — yet tales of his brutal cunning and wild strength have already spread across the grazelands, and many whisper that he is destined to forge a path soaked in blood and glory.\n\n#bold Can Gnaar-vi, the young Cubkhan, unite the fractured tribes of the Ashlands under his fiery will, or will his legend wither before he even comes of age?#!"
   bm_ashlander_ghost_snake:0 "Camaeril of the Mabrigash Tribe"
   bm_ashlander_ghost_snake_desc:0 "In the shadowed lands within the Ghost Snake Vale, where mist clings to the soil and the air hums with unseen spirits, the Mabrigash tribe endures. Guided by visions and bound by ancient rites, the women of the tribe revere the Ghost Snake, an enigmatic being some whisper to be an echo of Sithis himself.\n\n#bold Camaeril#!, now leads her people through times of quiet peril. As the outside world encroaches, she must decide whether to cling to the secret ways of her ancestors or strike boldly into an uncertain future.\n\n#bold Will Camaeril honor the Ghost Snake's whisper and safeguard the Vale, or will ambition and change tear the Mabrigash from their sacred home?#!"
   bm_chimer_hlaalu:0 "Lord Velondril Hlaalu"
   bm_chimer_hlaalu_desc:0 "The Chimer wander through trials and destiny, bearing the wisdom of Prophet Veloth and the blessings of gods who once walked among them. In the rolling Grazelands of Resdayn, some see a sacred frontier where faith may flourish... others see fertile ground for ambition and power.\n\n#bold Velondril#!, the gregarious and grasping head of the Hlaalu family of Narsis, plays the game of power with a seasoned hand. In a land where honor is a mask and fortune is the true prize, he weaves alliances, barters secrets, and schemes against rival families to lift his family's star ever higher.\n\n#bold Will Velondril's cunning secure a dynasty of wealth and influence, or will the shifting sands of fate swallow even the most careful of players?#!"

   bm_dwemer_rourken_desc:0 "The Dwemer endure as architects of marvels, masters of deep lore and unyielding resolve. Among their proudest houses stands Clan Rourken, whose might and everlasting works are the envy of all who behold them.\n\nAkhzar #bold Rourken VII#!, known as 'the Brass-Hands' for his legendary prowess, has become a living embodiment of raw power tempered by a fiery personality. Loved by some and feared by many, he walks the fine line between a hero and havoc-bringer.\n\nFor generations, his proud clan has endured with unshaken resolve, standing firm through turmoil and disasters alike. But between the growing ambition of their nosy liege— and their dimwitted, gold-skinned neighbors, the patience of the Brass-Hands continues to wane. \n\nAkhzar Rourken must now decide whether to cling to their ancestral homes or forsake the old halls in pursuit of a future unbound by the errors of others.\n\n#bold Will Akhzar Rourken lead the Rourken to forge a new destiny beyond the mountains, or will pride and memory chain them to a crumbling past?#!"
   bm_dwemer_thuan:0 "Mzulchan Bthuan"
   bm_dwemer_thuan_desc:0 "#bold Mzulchan#! stands at the crossroads of history. His brass stronghold rises amidst the chaos of the Chimer's conflict, an unyielding bastion in a land of shifting allegiances and war-torn landscapes.\n\nIn the face of the Chimer's rapidly expanding influence. Mzulchan must preserve his kin's legacy from the relentless ambition of the Chimer — all while fending off those who seek to claim his land or extinguish his house.\n\n#bold Will Mzulchan be able to preserve his Clan's glory, or will the relentless march of the Chimer sweep it into the annals of forgotten history?#!"
   bm_rontha_steamcrag:0 "Chieftain Baelica 'The Steamforged'"
   bm_rontha_steamcrag_desc:0 "Born in the shadow of Red Mountain, where the earth trembles and the air is thick with ash, Chief #bold Baelica#! rose like a forge roaring to life. His ambition, shaped by the fires of the land and the steam crags that surrounded him, is as fierce and unyielding as the mountains themselves.\n\nThe Ronthas are a proud and ferocious Nedic tribe, once heard the wind whisper their names with reverence. But with each passing moon, they are driven further from the ember rivers and the fiery heart of the Stonefalls Mountain that once cradled their birth. Baelica, now Chief, stands as the last flicker of a fading legacy — a burning ember in a world growing colder with each year.\n\n#bold Will Baelica's steam-forged will forge a new destiny for his people, or will the passing of time snuff out the flame of the Rontha forever?#!"

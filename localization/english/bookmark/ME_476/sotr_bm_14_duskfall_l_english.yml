  #14 Duskfall

  bm_duskfall:0 "The Duskfall"
  bm_duskfall_desc:0 "The deep swamps of Black Marsh remember a time of grandeur. The Saxhleel once rose like scaled gods from the mire, building cities of obsidian and jade that thrummed with Hist-born magic. But now, the old Saxhleel civilization wanes, the elders tried their hardest to claw themselves up to the surface, desperate to reclaim the past glories buried beneath them. But the Hist, in its own unfathomable will,  continues to swallow their monuments stone by stone.\n\nEach race, each tribe, each would-be heir to the marsh’s soul strives to reclaim a legacy in ruin. The Hist still speaks, but faintly—its voice muffled, as if lost in waterlogged stone. Only a chosen few can still hear its truths. \n\nWhat endures the Deep Marshes does not escape unchanged. Memory becomes a vessel for the horrors that dwell in the dark, shaped by loss, etched in shadow, and they're forced to wear their resilience like a scar. Now, as the final stages of the Duskfall are upon them, survival is all that matters.\n\n#bold In the depths of the Marsh, where light fades and ancient horrors stir, who will rise from the mires—and who will drown in the fall?#"
  bm_argonian_helstrom:0 "King Shatum-Zei of Helstrom"
  bm_argonian_helstrom_desc:0 "In the murky heart of Black Marsh, where the sun is but a memory and time flows like still water, the Duskfall has long since taken root—and its shadow has lingered ever since. The old Saxhleel civilization continues to fade with each passing tide, their stone ziggurats swallowed by vine and bog. \n\nBut not all has sunk into silence. In the depths of the ancient city of Helstrom, a towering shadow stirs — #bold Shatum-Zei#!, the mighty Naga King and a living heir to the legendary Gulum-Ei.\n\nBroad of scale and dark as riverstone, Shatum-Zei is feared not only for his callous, unblinking resolve, but for the sharp approach in which he deals with his enemies. Calm as the still marsh, patient as the creeping vine, he watches over his enemies until fate clings to them like shadow. \n\nThe Hist, in their deep wisdom, have blessed him with the powers of a Soaring Behemoth. The Behemoths are those who were granted with immense size and terrifying physical strength, shaped for a purpose known only by the Hist itself.\n\n#bold As the world around him crumbles into memory, Shatum-Zei endures. Will he cling to the roots of old, or become something greater?#"
  bm_argonian_shuxaltsei:0 "Xulneihavu Shuxaltsei"
  bm_argonian_shuxaltsei_desc:0 "In the dark jungles of Murkmire, where roots writhe like serpents and the very air seems to bleed, whispers still echo of a name spoken only in hushed tones. The High Priestess of Teeth, #bold Xulneihavu Shuxaltsei#! was once a revered servant of Sithis, she turned from the shifting will of the Hist and embraced a more dreadful vision.\n\nShe drenched her altars in sacrifice and chanted rites long forgotten, seeking not change, but the unmaking of all things. As the Hist evolved to see Sithis as an agent of transformation, she clung to the old vision of the Void: cold, pure, final. When the Duskfall came, and the Saxhleel faltered, she struck — not to rule, but to end.\n\nThe tribes rose against her. They say she was cast down and entombed far from the Hist, never to rise again. But darkness lingers, and blood magic festers in the deep places of the world. Now, with war and silence spreading across Black Marsh, something stirs beneath the Teeth of Sithis once more.\n\n#bold Will you bring about the Void-Womb's return and drown the world in sacred silence, or will Shuxaltsei's ancient evil be buried again beneath fang and root?#"
  bm_argonian_stonewaste:0 "Tun-Zeeus of the Stonewastes"
  bm_argonian_stonewaste_desc:0 "Within the bleak, mist-choked swamps of Blackwood, where the remnants of the great Saxhleel dwell and the earth trembles with forgotten fury, the Stonewastes endure. From atop their ancient Xanmeers, #bold Tun-Zeeus#! rules with an iron fist — a sovereign carved from stone and hate, who forgets no slight and grant mercy to none.\n\nThe Duskfall has only deepened his wrath. As the Hist beckon their children toward rebirth and regression, Tun-Zeeus recoils in contempt. The half-naga yearns to become something far greater and he’s done with being a child of the swamp. \n\nHis bloodline was born for conquest and ruin. Where others withered or went mad, he thrived, Amber Plasm coils through his veins like molten blood.\n\nThat power reshaped him—and with it came clarity. He turned from the Hist and bent the knee to a new master— Mehrunes Dagon, the Daedric Prince of Destruction, whose searing wrath mirrors his own.\n\nHe does not seek to return to the jungle. He means to raise the Xanmeers higher than ever before—to defy the Hist, to reject their future, and to destroy them.\n\n#bold Will you follow Tun-Zeeus into fury and fire, reshaping the Marsh in your image, or will his burning vengeance consume all — even his own people?#"
  bm_argonian_stormhold:0 "Xil-Xotl of Mazzatun"
  bm_argonian_stormhold_desc:0 "Deep in the tangled, steaming heart of Shadowfen lies a city that defies all Argonian tradition — a place of spiraling stone, shifting walls, and mad purpose. Mazzatun, the Puzzle City, has stood for centuries — not in ruin, but in endless construction. \n\nIts creators, the Xit-Xaht tribe, were branded 'crazy' by the other Saxhleel for their tendencies to build things without pause. And at their head is #bold Xil-Xotl#!, a stoic and blessed guardian, shaped by the will of their Hist, Tsono-Xuhil.\n\nTsono-Xuhil does not bleed regular hist sap like most others — it weeps 'Amber Plasm', an otherworldly and chaotic substance. From this mad source, Xil-Xotl became Amber-Blessed, reborn as a soaring lizard of immense power and unnatural clarity. \n\nAs the Duskfall drapes Black Marsh in shadow and silence, Xil-Xotl walks the city like a pillar of virtue and might, defending his borders from the Ayleid Kings and suspicious human tribes who encircle Mazzatun like vultures.\n\n#bold Will you continue to build the impossible and protect the Puzzle City from within, or will the walls of Mazzatun become a prison of stone, amber, and madness?#"
  bm_chimer_dres:0 "Thalthil Dres 'the Dreadsower'"
  bm_chimer_dres_desc:0 "Known across the other Revered Families as the 'Dreadsower', his reputation for cold calculation and ruthlessness have made even the wealthiest of his rivals tread lightly. \n\nBorn into one of the richest and most powerful lineages in Resdayn, #bold Thalthil#!'s hunger for more is not really born of need, but of pure ambition—an ambition to shift the scales and elevate the Chimeri economy to an entirely new level.\n\nTo the south, the ancient lizard-folks of Black Marsh falter. Their unity splinters and their people wither like smoke. Where others see impassable bogs, Thalthil sees an opportunity, ripe with untapped spices, alchemical rarities, and more lands waiting to be subjugated.\n\n#bold Will you sow fear and reap more fruits as Thalthil the Dreadsower, or will your roots rot under the shadow of unending ambition?#"
  bm_kothringi_rockguard:0 "Norrad of Rockguard"
  bm_kothringi_rockguard_desc:0 "Where the rivers of the Heartlands meet the deep-rooted wilderness of Black Marsh, the silver-skinned Kothringi of Rockguard endure — protected by their pragmatic leader. #bold Norrad#! struggles to remain unshaken by the chaos consuming the world around him.\n\nNow, as the end of the Duskfall creeps ever closer, the great lizards of the Marsh continues to fracture, more native humans get caught in the grip of oppression, and the elves grow ever hungrier for dominion. \n\nNorrad's mind would often wonder at the endless expanse of the stars, where he wrestles with the contradictions of mortal nature: How elves who shape beauty can also forge chains to enslave other; how men who cry for freedom would still draw innocent blood; how both light and darkness dwell within every soul.\n\nThough burdened by these great conundrum, he is not broken by it. Norrad continues to stand — not only as a protector of his people, but as a beacon for all humans who dare to dream of a brighter future\n\n#bold Will Norrad lead the Kothringi from the Dusk and into a new Dawn, their silver shining bright as the stars? Or will his dreams be drowned by the rising tide of vengeance and ruin?#"
  bm_lilmothiit_ama:0 "Ma Dyaan"
  bm_lilmothiit_ama_desc:0 "#bold Ma Dyaan#! stands as a beacon of strength and blooming resolve among the Lilmothiit of Blackrose. Born into the fabled Dyaan line, her legacy is deeply rooted in a profound bond with the land and a natural aptitude for leadership, which has long inspired loyalty and reverence among her people.\n\nYet beneath her composed exterior lies a family in quiet disarray. Though she and her siblings share the same noble blood, harmony among them is scarce. Her closest bond was once with her brother Anoo, whom she had a love-hate relationship with. However, Anoo has now taken to the seas, carving out a life as a pirate far beyond her reach. In his absence, Ma finds herself surrounded by estranged siblings, each ruling their own fiefdom and guarding their own ambitions.\n\nDespite their differences, Ma hopes that her siblings would understand the necessity of having each other's back in the face of external threats—be it the encroaching Xanmeeri Lizards and the surge of vampiric corruption to the unspeakable horrors that stir within the shadowed corners of Black Marsh.\n\n#bold As the weight of the Dyaan Dynasty rests on her shoulders, can Ma overcome the fractures within her bloodline and unite her people? Or will the shadows of discord tear the Lilmothiit apart from within?#"

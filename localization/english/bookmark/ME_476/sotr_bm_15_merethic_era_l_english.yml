  #15 Wanning Years of the Merethic Era

  bm_merethic_era:0 "The Waning Years"
  bm_merethic_era_desc:0 "Across every corner of the continent, ancient powers stir, new realms rise, and old legacies strain under the weight of change, veering in-between myth and history. As the final centuries of the Merethic Era unfold, the fate of Tamriel hangs in the hands of its greatest players.\n\nIn the far north, Ysgramor forges a new dynasty with his axe and fury, as his Companions carve southward in search of conquest, purpose, and legacy. Around him, the balance of power begins to shift—chaotic and uncertain, shaped by various causes.\n\nAcross mighty vales and towering mountains, the Elven realms move through trials of their own. Some still gleam with the elegance of old, while others stand on fragile ground—haunted by loss, divided by doubt, or burdened by massive catastrophes. From crumbling sanctuaries to courts heavy with silence, the choices before them grow more urgent.\n\nAll feel the pull of the age turning. Some rise in defiance, others drift in hesitation, but none remain untouched. Even the mightiest of Dominions, cloaked in splendor and power, must tread carefully, for the Golden Age of the Elves now teeters on the edge of transformation.\n\n#bold As the Merethic sun sets, who among these players will define the dawn of the next age—and who will vanish with the twilight?#"

  bm_ysgramor_saga_desc:0 "#bold Ysgramor#!, the legendary warrior of Atmora, lays the unshakable foundation of his new dynasty. From his seat in Windhelm, he commands the fabled Companions—his loyal shield-brothers and sisters—as they carve their legacy into the wild and war-torn lands of Mereth.\n\nThough the remnants of the Snow Elves and Giants still exists, Ysgramor's wrath and determination have shown itself to be a force beyond reckoning. Each stronghold raised and each battlefield claimed by the Atmorans tightens their grip on Mereth, slowly transforming their fruits of conquest into a new homeland.\n\nYet Ysgramor now stands at a crossroads. The fires of vengeance that once drove him burn less brightly with each passing year. His trusted friend Jeek of the River, wise and weathered, urges restraint—consistently reminding him that those responsible for the 'Night of Tears' have already paid their price in blood. Jeek speaks of a better legacy, of focusing themselves entirely on building a better future for the generations to come.\n\nBut not all of Ysgramor’s Companions share this vision. Companions such as Rhorlak, Reynir the Destroyer, and the Brothers of Mace-Face Violence call for the continuation of their bloody crusade. They urge the Harbinger to continue #italic mowing through the northern snows #!, to scour the hateful goldskins throughout [Glossary( 'the fields of the Clouded Sun', 'RESDAYN_GLOSS' )], and to topple the demonic towers within the south. \n\nYsgramor hears them all, caught between two worlds—between the echo of ancient grief and the uncertain promise of a new dawn for the Children of the Sky.\n\n#bold Which path will Ysgramor choose? Will Ysgramor’s legacy be forever etched in blood and wrath? How will Ysgramor choose to end the Songs of the Return?#"

Lord #bold Hirgelion#! remains tormented by the greatest defining failure of his life. \n\nThe 'Fall of the Snow Prince' shattered not only the last glimmer of hope for the entire Snow Elven people, but also a part of Hirgelion himself. For that was the day he arrived too late to stand beside his liege during his Final Stand at Moesring.\n\nNow, the vile Atmoran warlords press ever deeper into Falmeri lands, driving the snow elves from their ancestral homes and forcing them to seek refuge beyond the western mountains within Hirgelion’s realm. With the influx of desperate refugees swelling within his territory, Lord Hirgelion sees not just a burden, but also a renewed sense of purpose. \n\nAmid the wind-scoured remnants of his people, Hirgelion seeks redemption. He dreams of amassing a new great army from the scattered Snow Elves, rekindling the frostbound glory of a fallen kingdom, and proving that the legacy of the Falmer did not die with the Fall of the Snow Prince.\n\n#bold Can Lord Hirgelion rebuild a new kingdom for the Snow Elves?

Though his title suggests rulership over the Heartlands, Malaran is no true High King. Like his forebears, he is but a delegate, a gilded representative of the true power that reigns supreme above all: the Royalty of Alinor.\n\nAnd yet, even as a mere proxy of the Summerset Crown, Aynorr lives a lavish lifestyle within the White-Gold Tower. His court rivals any in grandeur, and the Sorcerer-Kings and Queens of the Heartland are compelled to kneel in his presence. For he, too, shares blood with their true liege—the nobles of the House of Auriel, being cousins to Alinor’s divine blooded rulers.\n\nBut such prestige has also bred contempt. Behind silk curtains and within towered sanctums, the Sorcerer-Kings sneer at their blood-bound overlord. They believe that mastery of magic—not lineage—should define supremacy. Were it not for the ever-watchful eyes of their Summerset cousins, many whisper, the line of Aynorr would have ended long ago.\n\nNow, the situation grows even more perilous. The Daedra-worshipping Ayleids stir with violent fervor, and the Narfinsel Schism threatens to topple his rule altogether. The 'Great Empire' of the Ayleids, which has endured for centuries, now teeters on the edge of annihilation. \n\n#bold Can Malaran Aynorr hold together a fractured realm while walking above the knife’s edge?

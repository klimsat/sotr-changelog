  bm_war_of_raht:0 "War of Raht"
  bm_war_of_raht_desc:0 "On the twilight of the Merethic Era, when Elsweyr was composed of sixteen proud and sovereign Kingdoms—the moons danced in a strange and fateful pattern. Jone and Jode, in their divine mischief or wisdom, aligned in ways unseen in living memory. From this cosmic ballet were born the great rahts—towering Khajiits blessed with immense strength and stature. Never before had so many of these towering Khajiits been fated to be Kings and Queens all at once.\n\nAll across the deserts, jungles, and savannahs of ancient Elsweyr, these colossal figures of prominent clans and dynasties rose to their respective titles. Some were wise and just, others cruel and ravenous—but all seeks to expand their Pride.\n\nNow, their kingdoms clash. Mountains tremble as the War of Rahts begins, with armies marching under moon-blessed banners and great beasts carrying monarchs of great ferocity. The moons still shift strangely above, and the faithful whisper that the Lunar Lattice has not yet finished its tale.\n\n#bold Even when the gods choose many champions, only one can truly rule. Who among the Rahts will rise—and who will fall beneath the weight of moons and pride?#"
  bm_khajiit_dune:0 "Thokka of Dune"
  bm_khajiit_dune_desc:0 "From the drylands of Northern Anequina rises the majestic white beast — #bold Thokka#!, the Raht-King whose roar echoes across Elsweyr. Born under the waxing phase of both Jode and Jone, Thokka was born as a great beast who was set to be a pious sovereign like those before him. \n\nYet in a surpising turn of event, fate spoke otherwise. Cold-blooded, cunning, and unyielding, his claws transformed his forebears’ legacy of piety into fear. Not even the harsh winds and endless white sands of Dune could contain his cruelty, which spread far beyond his homeland.\n\nAs he grows older, Thokka’s vision stretches beyond the arid reaches of his Kingdom. He dreams of reforging the ancient thrones of Elsweyr, molding them into one so that he may rule as the mighty Moon-Emperor — whose will is law, and whose pride knows no bounds.\n\n#bold Will you unite Elsweyr beneath your banner, or will your ambition sink into the sands with all who came before you?#"
  bm_khajiit_meirvale:0 "Sabanurr of Meirvale"
  bm_khajiit_meirvale_desc:0 "In the shadowed valleys of Meirvale, where the tall grasses whisper of unseen predators, reigns #bold Sabanurr#! — the towering Cathay-Raht whose shadow-speckled fur blends with the dusk, and whose green eyes burn with the unending thrill of the hunt. \n\nUnlike his forebears, who revel in feasts, drink, and endless celebration, the Jaguar-King devoted his life to the hunt. The thrill of pursuit, the scent of blood, and the call of the wild are his true indulgences.\n\nAs the flames of war erupt across Elsweyr, he views the other squabbling Khajiiti monarchs not as rivals, but as his prey. To the Hunt-Lord, conquest is no game of politics or power, but the purest expression of nature’s law.\n\nWithin his domain, he forced his people to see war as a sacred hunt, and his realm has become a martial crucible where peasants and war-kin alike are forged into relentless hunting packs. The battlefield is an extension of the sacred hunt, where only the worthy endure and the unworthy are devoured.\n\n#bold Will you guide the Hunt-Lord to glory, or end up as one of his trophies?#!"
  bm_khajiit_orcrest:0 "Dar'ash of Orcrest"
  bm_khajiit_orcrest_desc:0 "In the arid heart of Anequina, rules #bold Dar'ash#! — the ruler of Orcrest. A Suthay-Raht born swift of limb and sharp of wit. With steady eyes on the horizon and instincts honed by years of hunting experience, few survive long enough to surprise him.\n\nWhile other Raht-Kings went and charge forward with tooth and claw, Dar'ash watches and strikes where their line is weakest. \n\nNo enemy can outpace him. No ambition escapes his notice. To move against him is to race against death itself.\n\n#bold Will you carry your banners across Orcrest, or be trapped in the snare of its ever-watchful King?#"
  bm_khajiit_rimmen:0 "Kh'intosh of Rimmen"
  bm_khajiit_rimmen_desc:0 "Amidst the clamor of war and the cries of conquest, Rimmen remains a bastion of grace and enduring strength. Its ruler, #bold Kh’intosh#!, born as a Cathay-Raht of distinguished lineage — stands imposing in stature, yet guided by compassion and discernment. \n\nRaised at the crossroads where the verdant lands of Nibenay meet the arid crags of Elsweyr, he has mastered the delicate art of harmonizing cultures and diplomacy.\n\nWithin the secluded valleys of Rimmen, the Khajiiti Kings who preceded him had offered refuge to the last of the free Nedes of the Niben Valley — shielding them from the grasp of the Heartland’s cruel Sorcerer-Kings. \n\nContrary to what others might believe, this act of benevolence is not born of weakness. It reflects the deep-rooted sense of justice and sacred hospitality instilled in them by the teachings of the Moons.\n\n#bold Should the war reach his doorstep—will the King of Rimmen be compelled to draw his claws and ride to battle? And if he does— will the Nedes ride alongside him?#"
  bm_khajiit_riverhold:0 "Ohemaa of Riverhold"
  bm_khajiit_riverhold_desc:0 "Amid the golden savannahs of northern Elsweyr, where the river cuts through parched stone like a silver thread, reigns Queen #bold Ohemaa#! — a Khajiit of both noble blood and spirit. \n\nA towering Cathay-Raht with eyes like burning amber and a voice that carries the weight of command, she rules Riverhold with fierce sense of justice and the majestic pride of her ancestors.\n\nRiverhold stands at a perilous crossroads. To the south, the Raht-Kings wage their brutal war for supremacy. To the north, the Sorcerer-Kings of the Heartlands eye her fertile borderlands with cruel ambition. \n\nOhemaa stands unbowed before these threats, for a Queen must do whatever it takes to protect her realm. If need be, she will ride with her war-prides beneath the blessing of the moonlight, and she will spill as much blood as is required to secure her Pride.\n\n#bold Will you uphold Riverhold’s honor and resist the darkness pressing in from every border, or seize your destiny and let the lioness loose upon the sands?#"
  bm_khajiit_vampire_hollowfang:0 "Mazzara of the Hollowfang Clan"
  bm_khajiit_vampire_hollowfang_desc:0 "#bold Mazzara#! and her coven dwell within the shadowed lair of Moongrave Fane, where moonlight seldom touches the ground and the air is thick with spiced blood and perilous secrets. \n\nMazzara, is no queen, nor a noble — she is a predator carved from hardship, raised by hunger, and reborn in blood. With a voice like silk and claws like razors, she leads her vampire kin in devotion to Sangiin, the blood god of passion, indulgence, and revelry.\n\nWhile the Raht-Kings and Queens rip Elsweyr apart in their brutal struggle for dominance, Mazzara watches from the dark with her bright eyes. To her, this war is no tragedy but a godsent opportunity. Chaos brings carnage, and carnage spills blood. \n\nEvery fallen warrior is a feast. Every shattered kingdom is ripe for the Hollowfang’s grasp. Her followers are slowly multiplying in secret, feeding on the lost and turning the broken into the children of the night.\n\n#bold Will you embrace the hunger and spread the Hollowfang curse across the sands, or will you resist Mazzara’s silent ascent until it is far too late?#"

  bm_war_of_the_rift_desc:0 "As fire and frost clash across pine and peak, the war drums echo through the valleys, and none who hear them remain in peace.\n\nVikord One-Eye, Companion-Captain of the Fallowfire and heir to Captain Gurilda Shark-Tooth, prepares himself for the impending storm. Nearby dwells the famed shield-maiden Grunilda Stormcrag, a Companion with her own fiery tales, now stands as a High Chietess. She is done seeking glory, but now Grunilda stands at a crossroads between her duty and desire. By the lake’s still waters, an orc chieftain watches in silence, and the Orc Chief is prepared to defend his home by any means necessary.\n\nFrom the cliffs, Aesril 'the White Death' is steadily hunting the colonizers from the shadows. Meanwhile, Lord Ilucar the Fear-Eater, a fearsome sorcerer and ruler—watches over with his sharp eyes. He weighs the cost of action, and whether vengeance is worth his strength. Beyond the high mountain ranges, Finglor 'the Righteous' rallies the fractured remnants of the snow-elves, forging a great army to reclaim the North from the northern invaders.\n\nAtmorans, giants, and snow-elves have all bled into the soil, staining the leaves with the blood of their fiery grudges. They all know that the continuation of the 'War of the Rift' is simply inevitable.\n\n#bold As the Rift burns and ancient powers stir, will you forge a new legacy—or be swallowed by the storm of the old?#!"
  bm_atmoran_vikord:0 "Vikord One-Ear"
  bm_atmoran_vikord_desc:0 "Before the bards ever sang of his name, #bold Vikord#! was little more than a mere deckhand aboard the Fallowfire. He earned his famous moniker in an early skirmish where an enemy raider nearly split head. Fortunately for him, he was saved by his Captain— the famed #bold #color_light_blue #italic Gurilda Shark-Tooth#! #! #! \n\nEven though he had lost an ear, Vikord would go on to prove his worth and loyalty a hundredfold. Fighting tooth and nail across the cold Atmoran shores with his crew, and eventually Vikord rose to the rank of first mate. \n\nBound by unshakable loyalty, Vikord and the crew of the Fallowfire would follow their captain through anything—through the deadliest tides, across the coldest seas, and even into the jaws of Oblivion itself, if need be.... \n\nWhen their Captain chose to aid Ysgramor, the crew did not hesitate for a moment to follow her in the quest to make the elves answer for what they had done. \n\nSwords and axes whirled through the icy air, and shields rang with thunderous clangs during the 'Retaking of Saarthal'. In the end, victory was secured at grievous cost. Yet despite their losses, their resolve remained unbroken. They rallied behind their captain and followed her into Mereth's uncharted wilderness. \n\nThey pressed south through the blizzards and the biting cold, each step a struggle against the howling wind and drifting snow. And just as the air began to warm and hope stirred in their hearts, the land betrayed their expectations. They stepped into a realm of hissing sulfur pools—scalding, treacherous, and choked with the stench of rot. \n\nAfter the long and arduous journey, they eventually arrived in a strange land where the red-gold autumn clings to the glades, painting the forest in a warm, fiery glow.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of untamed beauty and lurking peril, the Crews of the Fallowfire stand resolute, ready to fulfill their Captain’s newfound dream. \n\nGurilda dreams of a future where her people no longer shiver beneath Atmora’s endless cold—a dream that kindles new fires and have them feel a lasting warmth within the heart of the Rift.\n\nThere, they waged a massive war against the hostile Snow Elves and Giants who sought to stop their Captain’s dream. They struck with fury and fire, their blades blazing through frost as they fought relentlessly. The battle raged on for years, with bloodshed from sunset to sunset, season after season. \n\nThough the Companions eventually emerged on top, their victory came at a terrible cost. \n\nGurilda Shark-Tooth—the Companion-Captain of the Fallowfire—perished in the fray, along with Bergitte the Toothless, Kajord Eagle-Eye, and a host of other devoted Companions. Vikord who managed to survive, rose from the ashes to carry on their legacy. \n\nMany battles have been won and most of the land is conquered, but the war is not yet over. The last remnants of the Falmeri lords are still out there, and the blood of Giants still stains the trails of the Rift. Now, the burden falls to Vikord — the new Companion-Captain of the Fallowfire — to ensure that the sacrifices of those whom he owed his life to was not in vain. \n\nWith a sword in his hand and Gurilda’s voice in his memory, Vikord One-Ear prepares himself to write the final verses — of 'the War of the Rift'.\n\n#bold Will Vikord be able to meet his fallen Companions in Sovngarde with tales of Victory — or die trying to earn his place beside them?#"

  bm_atmoran_grunilda_desc:0 "The famed Companion Shield-Maiden #bold Grunilda#! Stormcrag was known for her fiery valor. Her tales echo with the clash of swords and the howl of the wind over broken battlements. \n\nBut now she rules from a hall of her own — with people who she governs and a loving family by her side. The clash of steel has faded into the hum of daily life, and her blade rests quietly by the fireside.\n\nHowever, word spreads of renewed bloodshed in the South, and it rekindles an old fire in her heart—one she had long thought extinguished. \n\nShe has built something worth protecting — a legacy of peace. Yet the thrill of battle still stirs her blood, filling her with eager anticipation.\n\n#bold Will she remain beside her kin and guard what she’s built — or ride once more into the storm, to aid her Companions, never to look back?#"
  bm_falmer_aesril:0 "Aesril the White-Death"
  bm_falmer_aesril_desc:0 "Lord #bold Aesril#!, one of the last scions of a shattered realm, now rules from the cliffs & hidden passes of the Rift. From snows and shadows, he strikes any invaders with precision and fury, exacting retribution for every stolen land and sundered hold.\n\nThough many deem his actions as acts of terror, Aesril perceives them as nothing short of justice. The War of the Rift is far from over. Should the Atmorans march once more in retaliation, he will not falter. He intends to take as many of them to the grave as Auri-el would allow — for his fallen kin, for his lost kingdom, and for the honor of the Snow Elves.\n\n#bold Will his vengeance carve the justice he seeks — or consume what little remains of his people in fire and frost?#"
  bm_falmer_finglor:0 "Lord Finglor 'the Righteous'"
  bm_falmer_finglor_desc:0 "Beyond the towering ranges of the Jerall Mountains, where ancient towers pierce the mist and frost never yields, Lord #bold Finglor#! of House Lorias is rallying what remains of his people. \n\nTo his deep regret, Finglor was not there to stand with the rest of his kin to fight against the human invaders or fight beside the Snow Prince at his final hour. \n\nBut in truth, it was not cowardice that held him back. Lord Finglor was entrusted to defend the southern borders of the Falmeri realms against insatiable ambitions of the power-hungry Sorcerer-Kings, a sacred duty he upheld ever faithfully.\n\nAfter the word of the Atmoran's atrocities against his kin carries on the wind like ash, Finglor's heart burns with a new purpose. Finglor is willing to do whatever it takes to seek justice for his family and set things right. He has cast aside old grudges, calling banners from the other remaining Falmeri lords and is even willing to extend a wary hand to his former Ayleid foes. \n\nThe Atmorans may rejoice, thinking the war is over. But alas, they have not yet faced the true wrath of winter. \n\n#bold Will Lord Finglor forge a new unity among broken kingdoms and reclaim the North — or will vengeance consume what hope remains?#"

  bm_falmer_ilucar_desc:0 "From the shadowed spires of his cold dominion, Lord #bold Ilucar#!, called 'the Fear-Eater', watches the world unravel. A master of the forbidden arts and cruel practices, he is whispered of with dread even among his own kin. The courts of the Snow Elves scarcely ever welcomed him, and his name spoken only in low regard.\n\nYet now, with the North in flames and the Atmoran tide rising, the Snow Elves are facing the greatest calamity they have ever known. The other Falmeri lords may scoff and shudder, but they cannot deny his value to their cause. \n\nThe Fall of the Snow Prince may be a profound tragedy for his people. Yet within that calamity lies a perilous opportunity—one that Ilucar may seize to redefine himself in the eyes of his people.\n\n#bold Should he lend his Mystic craft to those who have always spurned him? or will he turn his back, and let the Atmoran punish those who used to mock him?#"

Long before the Atmoran warbands spilled onto the shores, the Orcs had already called these lands home. Their blood runs deep in the roots, their claim older than memory.\n\nNow, the mountains echo with the drums of war that grows closer with each passing moon. Though his heart belongs to his home and his blade to his kin, the Chieftain’s duty is clear. He must ensure the survival of his people, even if it means forging a bitter alliance in a war not of his making.\n\n#bold Will he stand alone against the storm and hold fast to ancient soil — or be swept away in the many wars to come?#"

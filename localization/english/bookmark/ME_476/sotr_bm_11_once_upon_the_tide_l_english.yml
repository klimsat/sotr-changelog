  bm_once_upon_the_tide_desc:0 "In the twilight centuries of the Merethic Era, the Abecean Sea shimmered with more than sunlight. As trade flourishes between the High Kinlords of Summerset, Balfiera and the Ayleid monarchs of the Imperatum Saliache, the sea lanes gleam with silks, spices, gems, and other sorts of valuables. Amidst the booming trade a new tide rises to lay claim to the spoils.\n\nCorsairs, cutthroats, and Pirate Captains may darken the tides—but it is the rise of the Pirate Kings that truly shakes the seas.

Even the Mighty Ayleid monarchs and Altmer Kinlords, masters of the arcane craft and great naval might, find themselves struggling to control the waves.\n\nBeyond the known trade routes, the western horizon is dotted with unmapped isles cloaked in storm and myth. Some say ancient things stir there—others say nothing at all.The sea is wide, and only the bold find favor upon it.\n\n#bold Will you rise as master of the tides—or vanish beneath them, like the many forgotten ships ships below you?#"

  bm_many_roads_desc:0 "From the frost-bitten reaches of the Jerall Mountains to the deep jungles of Black Marsh, legend tells of mythical wanderers of mysterious origins. Folks sing tales of how they saved lives, raised banners, gain crowns—only to cast them aside and chase the horizon anew..\n\nTheir tales are shrouded in mystery. No one knows whence these #bold Wanderers#! came, nor which of them truly belongs to this era. Yet here they stand, any of them are yours to choose for your adventure."

  bookmark_laamps_pelinal_whitestrake_desc:0 "Before the First Era’s light shine upon Tamriel, a ‘Glorious knight’ strode through the heartlands, from kingdom to kingdom — bringing fear or hope, depending on the shape of your ears. The Legendary knight was known as #bold Pelinal Whitestrake#!. \n\nThe white haired warrior loves to swing his #italic sword#!, #italic grind#! his mace, and slay any monster who are unlucky enough to be in his presence. \n\nAt times, he also likes to aid the oppressed Nedes in casting down their cruel kings, and bring justice to realms that had long forgotten it.\n\nWhen kings bowed and banners flew at his command, he'd be offered thrones and titles by those he had freed — only for Pelinal to simply walk away and vanish into the roads. His footsteps haunt every elven caravan, and his legend lingers in every whisper throughout the far horizons.\n\n#bold When elves grew proud and men’s hearts frayed — Prepare to face Pelinal's blade.#"

He's the one and only— #bold Harrald Hairy-Breeks#!.\n\nWhen vengeance was sated and the city was reclaimed, Harrald had no wish to linger or bask in triumph. Ysgramor himself offered him a position of power and lands to settle. But despite all the rewards offered, Harrald refused. He had no need for keeps or courts—only the thrill of the open road and adventure.\n\nAnd so he wandered Mereth like wind through the mountain passes — cold, wild, and free. He went from hold to hold with snow in his beard and a grin on his face. The Hairy-Breeks fought when challenged, drank when welcomed, and would vanish before the fire burned low.\n\n#bold When there’s booze to drink and foes to slay — Harrald Hairy-Breeks is on the way #"

For the deep jungles seethe with unspeakable horrors—pulsing with ancient predators and cruel spirits that stalk without mercy. \n\n#bold When hope runs thin and danger knocks — that’s where you’ll find Hans the Fox #"

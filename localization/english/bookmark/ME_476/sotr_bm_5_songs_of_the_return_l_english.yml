  bm_songs_of_the_return_desc:0 "When the survivors of 'the Night of Tears' crossed the Sea of Ghosts, they brought with them not only sorrow, but also a new purpose. Ysgramor and his sons gathered a host of Atmorans to return—and they swore an oath that would shape the fate of Tamriel itself. With Torcs of Atmoran steel, forged in fire and under the gaze of the totem gods —they make their sacred vow:\n\n#color_blue_gray "By blood and steel, we swear this solemn oath: We shall fight to our last breath—To avenge our people slain during the Night of Tears,—And to honor the fallen by ensuring that all of our children can live and prosper within the newfound lands." #! \n\nThe vow, once a symbol of unity, now reveals the divided hearts of those who bear it. For some, it shines as a promise of a hopeful future—a call for justice beyond bloodshed. Others wield it as a fuel for vengeance, determined to erase every last trace of what once wronged them. \n\nYet not all tread these paths out of conviction. Ambition whispers louder than honor in some, luring them from the sacred road into the path of dominion.  Yet no matter which path taken, the enemies of the oathbearers feel its force—hunted, scattered, or broken beneath its might. \n\n#bold Will the natives of Mereth survive the coming tide? Will the Companions uphold their sacred vow?—or will they forge a new legacy in this land of blood and snow?#!"
  bm_atmoran_jeek:0 "Jeek of the River"
  bm_atmoran_jeek_desc:0 "As the Companion-Captain of the Jorrvaskr and one of the original founders of the legendary Sky-Forge, #bold Jeek of the River#! is a name spoken with high reverence among the Atmorans. His moniker was bestowed by none other than his oldest living friend, Ysgramor the Harbinger, reflecting both Jeek's current dwelling and the enduring bond between them. \n\nAbout two decades ago, Jeek stood beside Ysgramor in Atmora, as the snow fell around them, axe in hand and fire in their hearts, they all swore an oath in the name Kyne and the other Totem gods. All of the Companions vowed to avenge the kin lost during the Night of Tears, and to honor them by ensuring that their descendants would live and thrive in the newfound lands. \n\nJeek gathered many of his loyal friends, and led them aboard the ship Jorvaskkr, crossing the treacherous Sea of Ghosts to fulfill their sacred vow. \n\nThe 'Retaking of Saarthal' was brutal, and many of his Companions perished in the chaos, their blood staining the snow. Jeek and his crew fought fiercely in the battle, but alas, after it’s done, they seek to fulfill the vow’s second promise.\n\nThey chose to embark on a journey together, driven by an unyielding resolve and guided by Kyne’s fateful hand. Their path, winding and uncertain, eventually led them to the banks of the White River, where they stumbled upon an ancient monument in the shape of a hawk, its eye ablaze with fire and its stone wings spreading wide. \n\nSeeing this as an omen from Kyne, Jeek and his Companions dragged their ship all the way up to the hills near the White River, and they built themselves a home in the strangely empty and fertile grazelands. There, Jeek raised his children, cultivated the soil, and  laid the foundations of a new settlement for his people\n\nYet as the years wear on, Jeek watches with growing unease as his fellow Companions went on a darker path. What was once a quest for justice and camaraderie begins to blur into a blaze of unrelenting wrath. Jeek begins to question whether if his Companions still remember the purpose behind their initial vow in the first place.\n\n#bold Will Jeek remain true to his vision and help build a lasting future for the next generations of the Children of the Sky?#"

  bm_atmoran_jhoriul_desc:0 "In the crumbling ruins of ancient elven strongholds, Companion #bold Jhoriul#! of 'the Brothers of the Mace-Face Violence' leads a brutal campaign against the last remnants of Falmeri resistance. \n\nA warrior forged in the harsh crucible of Atmora’s unforgiving way of life, Jhoriul—along with his brother Knedl—were already notorious for their violent temperament long before they joined Ysgramor’s great campaign. Yet the war in Mereth dragged Jhoriul deeper into an even darker place, plunging him to new depths of depravity.\n\nNow, he marches without even a shred of mercy, crushing any remaining holdouts of the Snow Elves with iron resolve. His warband leaves behind only silence and scorched stone. Tales of his ruthlessness spread quickly—many Falmer surrender at the mere sight of his banner, knowing that none who saw his mace ever rise again. \n\nAround his wrist hangs the torc of the Companions—a mark of honor worn with unflinching pride. But more than that, it reminds him of the cruelty of his long-eared enemies. Jhoriul swore to fight to his final breath, to see the vile and treacherous Elves punished for their crimes.\n\n#bold Will any elves live to see the end of Jhoriul’s bloody crusade, or will his unyielding wrath doom even the Companions themselves?#"

  bm_kreath_pine_frost_desc:0 "In the frost-kissed pine forests south of Lake Ilinalta, Chieftain #bold Kerac#! of Kreath watches the horizon with growing dread. The blissful winds no longer stirs the trees as it once did. Now, they sway under the weight of an approaching storm. \n\nFrom across the Sea of Ghosts, hordes of new Atmorans continue to march ashore. Clad in iron and steel, with their hearts hardened by cold tales of reckoning and an unyielding desire to seize new lands.\n\nFor generations, people of Kreath had lived in an uneasy peace beside the Snow Elves and the Orcish clans. There was distrust, yes, but also trade, shared winters, and a begrudging respect forged through survival. \n\nNow, those bitter-warm memories are starting to fade like the last light before the night. With every Atmoran landing on the shores, the shadow draws closer.\n\nKerac is caught in a cruel crossroads. To raise his sword in defense of the Snow Elves may bring the fury of the Atmorans upon his people. Yet to stand idle may doom his old neighbors to be wiped out from history. \n\nThe Companions’ Oath was not his—yet its echo reaches even here, whispering through the frost-laden pines and into the quiet halls of Kreath.\n\n#bold Will Kerac find a path through the gathering storm, or will the Men-of-Kreath be the next to fall beneath the storm?#"

  bm_falmer_elricar_desc:0 "At Sungard, the valiant Lord #bold Elvariel#! makes his final stand. One of the last Snow Elven Lord in the North now walks among broken stone and ash— commanding the scattered remnants of his people in the greatest calamity they have ever known.\n\nThe Atmorans circle Sungard like a pack of rabid wolves, vicious and relentless. But even in these dark times, a flickering light still shines within the dark. The Snow Elven warrior refuses to surrender while his ancient blade, #italic Frostbringer#!, still thirsts for the blood of his foes. \n\nHe stands as a living reminder to all of Tamriel that a Snow Elf still draws breath in this world—and he is prepared to fight to his very last.\n\n#bold Will Sungard be the tomb of a forgotten people—or the spark that rekindles the legend of the Snow Elves?#!"

  bm_atmoran_hjaal_desc:0 "#bold Hjaal#!, the Companion-Captain of the Kaal-Kaaz and a close confidant of Ysgramor himself, now walks a path shrouded in shadow. Known for his cold cunning and unshakable resolve, his gaze—unlike the rest of the Companions—is no longer fixed on the Elves. Instead he turns his gaze toward the mighty Vales of Old Karth.\n\nThere, in those rugged highlands, dwell the Men of Karth—resourceful and fierce clans sworn to no king, led by the war-chief Marolan, called the Odd-Horned. The Vale is filled with a variety of rich ore veins ripe for the taking, and a bunch of proud people who refuse to let him claim it. \n\nHjaal's heart burns with a different kind of fire than that of his fellow Companions. Where most fight in the name of retribution, and others to fulfill oaths or prove their honor, Hjaal fights for his own dominion.\n\n#bold Will Hjaal carve a great legacy from the bones of the Karthmen—or lose himself in a conquest that betrays the sacred vow he once uphold?#"

Known among his people as 'the Odd-Horned' for the weird looking ram horn he wears... as well as his personality.\n\nThe Men of Karth have long lived apart from the struggles of elves and giants, and is still happily carving their lives from harsh lands with their bare hands and fierce pride. They are people of the stone, children of the Karth, and their songs are older than the Atmoran's first landing. \n\nBased on the unnerving rumors out there, the Chief simply said, "If the Atmorans offer peace, we will meet it with open hands—but if a stone is cast, we shall hurl it right back at them".\n\n#bold Can Marolan hold the vales in the name of the Old Gods—or will the last horn blare before the fall of Old Karth?#"

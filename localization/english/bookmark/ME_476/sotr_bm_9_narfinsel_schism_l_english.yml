  bm_narfinsel_schism_desc:0 "The Heartlands shimmer with power, their marble spires reaching toward the stars, and their halls echoing with the remnants of legendary rites. Here reign the mighty Ayleid Sorcerer-Kings and Queens of the Heartlands. Pioneers of magic, visionaries of art, and architect-kings of radiance, they shaped the land into a paradise of stone and starlight #italic (at least for the Elves)#!.\n\nYet beneath all of this festers a growing shadow. What once empowered the Ayleids—their rich diversity of thought and faith—now tears them asunder. As the Aedras & Daedras clash with one another, so too do their followers. The tension simmered for years in barbed words and petty slights, until it finally peaked in the catastrophe known as the #bold Narfinsel Schism#!.\n\nNone truly recall how it began. Some accuse the Daedraphiles for starting it, while others blame the Aedraphiles. Regardless of how it started, the rift between the two sides has now widened into an unbridgeable chasm.\n\nNow, their internal rivalries are igniting a great flame. A flame that is steadily consuming the 'Great Empire' of the Ayleids in a relentless blaze of ambition and discord.\n\n#bold Will the Imperatum Saliache be devoured by itself, or will someone rise above the chaos to weave its sundered glory into the Great Empire once again?#"

The city’s shadow looms large over the rest of the Saliache city-states, a constant presence both feared and revered. \n\nTo King Arion,  the so-called #bold [ayleid_struggle|E]#! is nothing more than a petty squabble among thin-skinned kings, who are far too quick to take offense.The Aedraphiles have never posed a real threat to him—for there is a far greater danger that looms beyond them. \n\nWithin the bright halls of Delodiil lies a power that cannot be ignored—a light that dares to challenge the shadowy reign of Abagarlas. Its ruler, the Sorcerer-King Elias of Delodiil, is the only Ayleid king whom Arion takes seriously—for the power of his sorcery and the strength of his realm stand as the only forces to match his own.\n\nFurthermore, great darkness keeps festering within his own bloodline. Arion also struggles to keep his power-hungry children, scheming cousins, and grasping kin from turning on each other in their endless pursuit of ambition and malice. Arion must hold his dynasty together through fear, blood, and sheer will.\n\n#bold Will you preserve the mighty legacy of Abagarlas against the growing false light of Delodiil—or will your own kin tear your kingdom apart from within?#!"

The land is bound by the iron will of its Sorcerer-King, the mighty #bold Fenareth Abasel#!.\n\nA fearsome warrior and devoted servant of #italic the Dark Warrior#!, Fenareth walks a path of discipline and sacrifice. Renowned among his people as both valiant and stern, his rule is guided not by personal glory, but by an unyielding will to secure strength and ensure the survival of Bawn.\n\nSurrounded by rival kingdoms and beset by intrigue, Fenareth must navigate a treacherous world where power is never enough, and even the boldest kings can fall to betrayal.\n\n#bold Will you forge Bawn into a bastion of Boethiah's might—or will the cold isolation of leadership see your kingdom wither from within?#!"

Under Meridia’s light, Delodiil has flourished into one of, if not the, mightiest Kingdom within the Imperatum Saliache.\n\nBlessed by #italic the Lady of Light#! herself, the members of House Aralatta are renowned for their valiance, radiant beauty, golden voices, and mastery of light-sorcery. \n\nWhere such might and power shine, peril and jealousy are never far behind. Chief among the troublemakers are the worshippers of Molag Bal—the most dangerous of them all being the fiends of Abagarlas.\n\nWhile King Elias regards the #bold [ayleid_struggle|E]#! as a serious concern, he truly believes the conflict is solvable—if only his Daedraphile and Aedraphile brothers and sisters could sit together for ten minutes without hurling curses...\n\nBut Abagarlas is another matter entirely. To King Elias and the rest of his Kin, these followers of #italic the Prince of Domination#! are nothing more than sadistic vermins, caring for nothing but their endless desires. Given the chance, they would gladly help their Cursed Prince enslave and unravel Nirn itself. \n\nKeeping them in check is a far greater priority to him than spilling the blood of his Aedra worshipping cousins.\n\n#bold Will you defend Delodiil’s shining glory against the darkness—or will your house’s brilliance be dimmed by treachery and pride?#!"

Nilichi has secretly devoted himself to a dark ancient insect god whose hunger knows no bounds. His subjects, though outwardly adoring, live in silent terror—knowing that to cross their sovereign is to court a fate worse than death.\n\nNow, his gaze turns eastward toward the Nedic Gemha tribes, whose blood could prove to be a fitting offering to his nameless, hungry god.\n\n#bold Will you maintain Nilichi’s mask of beauty and benevolence—or will you let the monstrous truth beneath the flowers consume all before you?#!"

Watching their success with a calculating eye, the Queen sees opportunity. She sees a chance to incorporate the city of Elinhir into her realm, add the Perena as her subjects—and to spread the reach of Ayleid settlement ever deeper into the frontiers of Craglorn.\n\nThe growing need for more gold and more men has never been more urgent, especially with the disastrous and costly Schisms plaguing the Empire.

To the north of Trumbe lies the city-state of Niryastare, a realm devoted to the worship of the Daedric Prince of Paths, Ithelia. Hermaeus Mora, ever the briliant manipulator, has urged Phalavar to sack the city—his godly hatred for Ithelia festering in every whisper. \n\nYet, to Phalavar, the command seems illogical. For he deems that in this time of great schism, the Daedraphiles should have united against their common enemy, and it doesn't make any sense to turn on one another.\n\nWhy, Phalavar wonders, does his Lord issue such a command? Is it a test of loyalty, or is his Prince blinded by his hatred for Ithelia, even in these perilous times?\n\n#bold Will you follow your Prince’s command—or will you set aside the Prince’s wishes for the greater good, preserving unity against the threat of the Aedraphiles?#!"

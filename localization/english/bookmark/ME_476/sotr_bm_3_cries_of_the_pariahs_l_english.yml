  bm_cries_of_the_pariahs_desc:0 "There are places where even the wind seems to mourn, and none more so than the scattered isles that drift like broken teeth off Wrothgar’s northern coast. Jagged and bleak, these lands are home to no kingdom, no songs of victory—only silence, sorrow, and those who have nowhere else to go.\n\nBeneath the cold moons and wind-scoured skies, orcish clans chant ancient hymns that echo like the heartbeat of a fading age, while the Riekr tribes speak in hushed tones of a storm yet to break—though their stories, too, begin to slip into silence. Farther still, on the bleak and windlashed Grayhome Isle, Lord Eradeth of the Garlythi Clan turns from the ways of his ancestors to seek communion with Molag Bal, chasing the silent voice of a god who offers only emptiness in reply.\n\nTo the west, Blackbone Isle rises from the sea like a tombstone, where Lord Helcosse, the last of his Falmeri bloodline, wanders through ruins beside his undead beloved, their love long since lost—preserved not by passion, but by grief that refuses to let go. \n\nCast out by a world that no longer has a place for them, these souls now drift beyond the edge of myth, determined to end their stories on their own terms.\n\n#bold Will you walk beside the forsaken and uncover what keeps them bound to this bitter world? Or will your name, too, fade into the Dirges of the Cold Depths?#"
  bm_orc_fharun:0 "Chief Gorrkal of the Fharun Tribe"
  bm_orc_fharun_desc:0 "Long has Chief #bold Gorrkal gro-Gronnak#! stood watch over the halls of Fharun Stronghold. His compassionate bearing has carried his kin through decades of battles, famine, and countless trials. \n\nYet among the rival Clans, such compassion is seen as a huge weakness. To most adherents to the Code of Malacath, a chief who spares when he could slay, or who tempers strength with restraint, carries a sickness that dishonors Orcish ways.\n\nToday, the banners of Clan Fharun still fly high above the mountains of Wrothgar. Yet the years weigh heavy, and the chief’s bones ache with battles long past. Chief Gorrkal can feel that his days in this world are slowly waning.\n\n#bold Will his legacy endure beyond him, or shall Fharun's fires dim with the passing of its great Chief?#"
  bm_orc_luccin:0 "Chief Nashoba of the Luccin Tribe"
  bm_orc_luccin_desc:0  "Among the snows of the Wrothgarian mountains, the name of Clan Luccin is whispered like a curse. The clans warriors are known to be silent, swift, and merciless. Few ever see them coming... fewer still live to tell the tale.\n\nWhere others wage war with banners and boasts, #bold Nashoba#! strikes with the cold precision of a feral hunter. The warriors of Clan Luccin blend with the Wrothgarian landscape, their eyes gleaming like frost in moonlight, their howls echoing through the mountain passes as harbingers of death.\n\n#bold Will the pale wolves of Frostbreak carve a legacy in blood and snow, or vanish like mist beneath the sun?#"
  bm_orc_murtag:0 "Chief Umug of the Murtag Tribe"
  bm_orc_murtag_desc:0 "Among the tall mounts of Jehanna, where the stones embraced the everlasting snows, Chief #bold Umug gro-Tazgur#! leads the crafty Clan Murtag from within the cavernous halls of the Murtag Stronghold.\n\nThe Murtags have hewn various wonders from the bedrock—vast halls, echoing forges, and statues that seem to breathe with ancient power. To foes, they are immovable as the cliffs— to allies, a foundation as unshakable as the mountain’s heart.\n\n#bold Will Umug’s legacy be carved into the stone for all time, or will it crumble beneath the weight of coming storms?#"
  bm_falmer_helcosse:0 "Lord Helcosse"
  bm_falmer_helcosse_desc:0 "Blackbone Isle rises like a tombstone from the bleak seas, save for one who would not let death have the final word. Lord #bold Helcosse#!, last of a forgotten Falmeri bloodline, lingers in solitude with the love of his life, now bound to undeath by his own desperate hand.\n\nThey drift through crumbling halls like phantoms, whispering old words into a silence that will never answer. What was meant to preserve their love has only preserved their sorrow, and each spellwoven memory turns to dust a little more with each passing year.\n\nTragic news continues to flow from the east—of the final stand of the Last Snow Prince, and of how his people were trampled beneath the boots of northern invaders. Though Helcosse was cursed and exiled by his kin for his dark practices, even he cannot help but mourn them, and feel the slow death of Falmeri culture in his bones.\n\n#bold What action, if any, can still be taken when all the world has already forgotten you?#"

  bm_riekr_bonecrack:0 "Chieftain Dryg of the Bonecrack Tribe"
  bm_riekr_bonecrack_desc:0 "High in the jagged peaks of the Wrothgarian Mountains, where even the snow cuts like a blade, the Bonecrack Tribe endures under the leadership of Chief #bold Dryg#!.\n\nTo outsiders, the Bonecrack are nothing but beasts—raiders, little monsters who deserves no mercy. However, within their own communities, they maintain bonds of profound loyalty. They are willing to sacrifice anything to defend their homes and families against any threats, wherever those may arise.\n\n With each season, Orcs amongst others have tried to press further into their sacred lands, threatening to tear away what little remains of their ancestral ways.\n\n#bold Will the Bonecrack chief rise as a warlord to drive back the encroaching tide, or be remembered only as bunch of little howls of a bunch of small people?#"
  bm_vampire_eradeth:0 "Lord Eradeth of the Garlythi Clan"
  bm_vampire_eradeth_desc:0 "In the northernmost reaches lies the island of Grayhome, shrouded in mist and forgotten prayers. Here, Lord #bold Eradeth#! of the Garlythi Vampire Clan lingers in solitude. \n\nHe forsook the druidic ways and the whispered rites of the Forgotten Ones, seeking instead the chilling graces of Molag Bal.\n\nBut the voice of his dark god is lost to him, leaving only the endless void of unanswered prayers. What once felt like a glorious purpose has become an unending spiral of doubt and emptiness, with the cold winds of Grayhome as his only companions.\n\n#bold Is Eradeth a true servant of Molag Bal, or merely a man who has lost himself in the shadows of his own faith?#"

  bm_shadows_of_adamantia:0 "Shadows of Adamantia"
  bm_shadows_of_adamantia_desc:0 "In the gleaming waters of the Iliac Bay, the Balfiera Archipelago rises like a crown of stone and storm. At its heart stands the Adamantine Tower—gleaming like the dawn. It is the oldest edifice in Tamriel, a silent witness to the shaping of the world. Said to have been entered by gods and shaped by forces no mortal tongue can name, the Tower casts a shadow not only over the archipelago, but across all of history.\n\nFor centuries, the Elven Overlords have claimed lordship over Balfiera. But time erodes all things. Their grasp weakens, their influence thins, and whispers stir beneath the marble halls. Men and Mer alike—watch with patient eyes, their ambitions sharpening as the old order begins to falter.\n\nIn the high halls of the Great Elven Clans of Balfiera, in the green groves of Galen Tribes, the call of the Tower is heard. Some see salvation. Others see conquest. All see destiny.\n\n#bold The Tower calls. Will you rise from the shadows of Adamantia to claim it?#"
  
  bm_galen_greenheart:0 "Alaric 'the Greenheart'"
  bm_galen_greenheart_desc:0 "The wind sings its mournful song, and the Druids of Galen turn their gaze against the looming shadows. One of the fiercest among them is known as #bold Alaric#!, who stands unyielding in his resolve.\n\nHe is a living relic of a bygone time, one of the last great Arch-Druids of the Galenfolk. The teachings of Y'ffre runs deep in his blood, guiding him to lead as nature intended.\n\nBut now, the winds carry ill omens. The great Balfieri Clans—ambitious, powerful, unrelenting—continues to tighten their grip on High Rock. Their fleets prowl the coasts. Their emissaries offered lavish yet poisonous gifts. \n\nThey came and speak of unity, but Alaric knows well that they don't intend to honor it. He has foreseen what the Elves call 'just treatment' toward his people. One need only to look at the fate of their Glenumbran cousins, who have been tamed and shamed — living their lives as mere peasants and concubines.\n\nHe will not stand idle. So long as he draws breath, the fate that befell the Galens of Glenumbra shall never befall those under his protection.\n\n#bold Will you lead Arch-Druid Alaric to preserve the soul of Galen and defy the coming tide? Or will the last songs of the wild fade beneath the march of elven dominion?#"
  
  bm_ayleid_salas_en:0 "Sorcerer-Queen Ilyana"
  bm_ayleid_salas_en_desc:0 "The Sorcerer-Queen #bold Ilyana#! reigns over the glistening spires of Salas En. Her court is a place of elegance and ancient power, where arcane symphonies echo beneath silver domes and her every word is weighed like prophecy. \n\nWhile the Ayleid city-states squabble and posture—clinging to fading grandeur and bloodstained pride—Ilyana looks beyond their petty rivalries and ancient grudges. Her gaze is fixed upon the Adamantine Tower, the oldest and mightiest edifice in all of Tamriel.\n\nIn her eyes, the Imperatum Saliache as it stands is doomed to crumble, bound by incompatible traditions and faltering lords. But from its ashes, she dreams of uniting the her scattered people.\n\nThrough sorcery, conviction, and the sheer weight of the Tower’s presence, she will shape a future that endures. This all can be done through a new 'Imperatum Saliache' with herself at its center, and the Adamantine Tower as its unshakable spine.\n\n#bold Will you guide Ilyana in her ascent to claim the Tower and reshape the empire in her image? Or will her star fall to blades and betrayal?#"

  bm_duraki_thunder_king_desc:0 "From the storm-wracked shores of the Duraki Kingdom of Thorstad, where lightning dances across iron spires and thunder shakes the bones of the earth, #bold Gaar#! rules over the people of his realm as the war-forged Thunder-King. \n\nThough a loyal vassal to the High Kings of Craglorn, the Thunder-Kings are scarcely regarded as fully tamed by their liege lord. These long lines of battle-hardened rulers have carved their dominion through blood and steel, whose war cries have rattled the very mountains they now call home. \n\nAs the roaring storms over the Iliac Bay swell and stretch their dark wings across the horizon, the Thunder-King senses the shifting winds of fate. What others see as omens of doom, he sees them as the chance to rise.\n\nHe can come out of this, either as his Liege's Mighty Hammer, or as the one who breaks their ancient line altogether. The thunder drums for war, the storm approaches—and Gaar answers.\n\n#bold Will you carve a path of conquest in the Thunder-King’s name, claiming the Tower and dominion over the Illiac Bay? Or will the wrath of the stars bring his storm to an end?#"

Born beneath storm-wracked sails and cradled by creaking hulls, Lord #bold Firamo#! is the living embodiment of that statement.\n\nHe is the current head of Clan Aldvea, a long line of Balfieri lords who carved their fortunes from all manner of seaborne trade. From his seat in the wave-lashed port of Seaveil Spire, he commands a merchant fleet mightier than most navies, ferrying gold, spices, and secrets between various lands and the heart of High Rock. \n\nAnd yet, for all their prosperity— Clan Aldvea remains under the long and watchful shadow of the prestigious Clan Direnni. \n\nTheir rival Clan still continues to dictates the rhythm of power along the shores of High Rock, their spires casting contempt upon Aldvean ambition. The Dirennis scheme in their towering keeps while the ripples of conflict simmer just beneath the surface.\n\n#bold Will you chart Lord Firamo's course toward supremacy over the Direnni?

Clan Adarielle has long been known for its beauty and wealth—yet Ancar’s gaze drifts beyond such splendor.\n\nAmid the shifting power struggles among the Lords of the Iliac Bay, he seeks to secure a foothold along Balfiera’s shores and enter the fray. Having of a port that gazes upon the Adamantine Tower would greatly strengthen his position, enabling him to challenge the pre-eminent powers of the Iliac Bay.\n\nBut he seeks more than a mere view of it, for he intends to remake the ancient Tower into the seat of his new High Kingdom. A prestigious Kingdom more vast, beautiful and radiant than Summerset itself. \n\n#bold Will you lead Lord Ancar to carve a new throne upon the waves?

  bm_breton_dunard_desc:0 "From the mingling of Elven grace and Human grit, the crafty #italic Bretons#! were born. Among them walks the jolly #bold Dunard#!, a humble manmer with a heart as big as his gut.\n\nKnown throughout the steads as a kind and affable man, he is entrusted to lead his people from a modest domain nestled within the rolling glades of Glenumbra Moors. \n\nDunard is Married to Linwë, a sharp-witted and sharp-tongued elven maiden of Balfieri heritage. From their union came Verin, Dunard's only beloved son who somehow managed to be even more pompous than his mother. Folks are disappointed that he seems to have inherited none of his father’s likeable traits, save for his ears. \n\nBetween managing his son’s increasingly grandiose tantrums, searching for Old Periff’s missing cattle, dealing with Fat Connel’s goat that keeps eating everyone’s laundry, and dealing with the ever-watchful eyes of the Balfieri overlords, Dunard’s hands are always full.\n\nLately, rumors spread through the taverns of how the Breton folks are plotting to rise—not as vassals or 'curiosities' to the Elven Lords, but as sovereigns in their own right. They seek to rise as a people, bearing power, pride, and Kingdoms of their own. Many now look to Dunard, urging him and the other Breton figures to act and turn this vision into reality.\n\nBut Dunard had never really dreamt of living in great castles or holding vast power. His hopes are simpler. Dunard only wishes for fertile lands where every Breton child can grow up in— and be raised happily in a loving home.\n\n#bold Will Dunard free the Glenumbran Bretons from the shadows of the Balfieri Overlords? Or will his laughter fade beneath the crushing weight of rising empires?#"

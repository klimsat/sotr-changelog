  bm_songs_of_the_wild_desc:0 "The wilderness of Valenwood echoes with the untamed sounds of the hunt. Beneath the towering trees, where the earth is thick with the scent of graht and greeneries, the Wood Elves fight not just for the sport, but for survival.\n\nIn the north, the Ayleid Storm-Warden stands as a force of nature itself, commanding the winds and storms, seeking only to safeguard his lands and its people. Meanwhile, the Kingdom of Arenthia continue to weakens as time wears on, its once-mighty banners now flickering faintly in the breeze. The rulers watch as their authority fades, and the kingdom slowly slips from their grasp.\n\nCloser to the heart of the land, in the dense, mist-laden jungles, the Imgans are struggling to maintain their dominion over the forests of Valenwood. Once a proud and respected people, they Imgans are now caught between the forces of nature and the relentless bosmers at their doorsteps.\n\n The wilds of Valenwood are unforgiving—only the strongest will claim their prize.\n\n#bold As the horns of the hunt sound through the trees, who will emerge victorious in this unyielding struggle?"
  bm_ayleid_ilayas:0 "Stormwarden Ghaladorn of Ilayas"
  bm_ayleid_ilayas_desc:0 "On top of the cloudy cliffs of Malabal Tor stands the ancient Ayleid citadel of Ilayas. From within its glistening halls reigns #bold Ghaladorn#!. Not only does he rule Ilayas as its Sorcerer-King, he also carries the mantle of the illustrious Stormwarden, commanding wind and rain to shield his people from the savage tides.\n\nWithin his realm lies 'the Sphere of Storms', an ancient artifact forged in an age long forgotten. The Sphere draws power from the sky and sea, conjuring tempests to shatter enemy fleets, summon rains for the fields, and weave protective veils of mist over the coast. Without it, Ilayas could wither — its crops would dry, its defenses would crumble beneath the tides of the Malabal Coast.\n\nAs its King, Ghaladorn must safeguard the Ilayas at all costs. Should the Sphere fall into the wrong hands, his Kingdom would not merely collapse—the entire Northern [GetGeographicalRegion('mundus_tamriel_valenwood').GetName] might be unraveled by the very storms that once shielded it.\n\n#bold Will you safeguard your people, tame the wilds, and make the storms sing the songs of victory?#!"
  bm_bosmer_arenthia:0 "King Aerenthil of Arenthia"
  bm_bosmer_arenthia_desc:0 "Arenthia stands where the borders of Valenwood, Elsweyr, and the Heartlands meet—a kingdom with a long and rich history. Once a proud bastion of Bosmeri might, Arenthia’s banners now flutter over a crumbling realm, its rulers grows weaker and its people more restless.\n\nKing #bold Aerenthil#!, burdened by the failings of his forebears, faces a land slipping beyond his grasp. Bandit-lords and beastkin circle the outskirts... foreign eyes watch hungrily from the wilderness. If swift action is not taken, the wilderness itself will reclaim his kingdom, leaving nothing but ruins swallowed by vine and root.\n\n#bold Will you revive Arenthia’s fading glory, or be the last king to see its name whispered only in the songs of the wild?#!"
  bm_bosmer_camoran:0 "'Bare-Breeches' Reinar"
  bm_bosmer_camoran_desc:0 "Once upon a time, in the ancient forests of Grahtwood, #bold Reinar#! chased an unyielding prey through thorn and river, forcing him to cast aside the burdens of his cloth and civility. \n\nBloodied and unbowed, he returned wearing nothing, carrying only his trophy, and earning the name 'Bare-Breeches'. \n\nWith the wild songs continuing to echo in his heart, Reinar’s fame spreads among the scattered tribes of the Wood Elves. Rival chieftains whisper his name with awe and fear, while the deep forest watches with its ancient, patient eyes.\n\n#bold What daring act might he do next? has Y’ffre Himself blessed his steps? or has he unleashed a predator too wild for the Green to contain?#!"
  bm_bosmer_woodhearth:0 "Brelor 'the Hollow Horn'"
  bm_bosmer_woodhearth_desc:0 "In the tangled western wilds of Valenwood stands Woodhearth, the domain where the great Hunt is ever present. #bold Brelor#!, crowned with the hollowed skull of the great stag he felled on his first hunt, lives for the endless chase — a predator bound by blood and song to the wild ways.\n\nIn his domain, all who walk — beast, elf, or intruder — are either prey or predator, and none could ever leave unmarked. The Songs of the Wild sing of Brelor's hunts, each a hymn to the certainty of death and the fierce glory of life.\n\n#bold Will you continue your great Hunts? or will the Hollow Horn fall silent, forgotten by the forests that once revered him?#!"
  bm_imga_hectaran:0 "Vrokar Kraxar, Duke of Hectaran"
  bm_imga_hectaran_desc:0 "Deep within the mist-covered jungles of Hectaran, #bold Vrokar Kraxar#! struggles to maintain his dominion over a once-proud people. The Imgans now find themselves squeezed between the relentless forces of nature and the ambitious Wood Elves encroaching at their borders.\n\nAs the world around him shifts, Vrokar must navigate the fragile balance of power, or risk seeing his people become forgotten myths, swallowed by the ever-hungry wilderness.\n\n#bold Will you restore the Imga's pride, or watch as their ancient legacy crumbles under the weight of a changing world?#!"

  bm_ballads_of_the_arch_desc:0 "The Great Arch watches the sea like a wary priest, its stone casting long shadows over a world trembling with change. From fjord to firth, the old songs stir—some with hope, others with warning.\n\nFrom atop the great Arch, the world unfolds in tales of valor and strife. Grim tidings speak of blood-drenched sails from the far north, while many around the arch prepare to stand against the rising tide. Dreams of day and night weave through visions, as different cultures strive to unite even while fate frays. \n\nAlong the river, the Orcs endure with quiet, unshakable resolve. While from the cold depths of the northern sea, Colossal beings rises in the name of vengeance, vowing to raise a cairn of shattered longboats so that the world remembers why the giantfolk must never be trifled with.\n\nEach story, sorrowful or triumphant, echoes through time, all bearing witness as the stones and seas sing the ballads of the Arch.\n\n#bold When war songs rise beneath the Arch, whose voice will carry through the ages—and whose will vanish with the tide?#!"
  bm_atmoran_froa:0 "Froa 'Who Dreamt of the Day'"
  bm_atmoran_froa_desc:0 "Known among the Atmorans as a famed seer, this Companion bore the rare gift of foresight—binding her to the spirits of both past and future. Through her gift, #bold Froa#! saw a future filled with hope— a future where the Children of the Sky rise victorious in many great battles, ushering in a Golden Age of Men after 'the Return'. \n\nWhile Froa dreams of a bright future for her people, her twin sister Grosta—who shares her gift—beholds another story. She gazes into the depths of darkness, uncovering the grim truths that lie ahead.\n\nNevertheless, Froa has not lost hope. She holds steadfast in her own vision of a brighter tomorrow. Today, she leads the united settlers from Atmora and the native people of Karth, determined to shape the future she believes in. \n\nBy her side stands the humble Braich, a Karthman bound not by culture but by love and vow. Together, they strive to weave the gods of the Nedes and the totem-spirits of Atmora into a single song—a song that will herald a brighter day across the lands.\n\n#bold Will you bind night and day into one banner, or will the ballads unveil the tales of Grosta's prophecies?#"

  bm_falmer_calia:0 "Lady Callia 'the Winter-Hag'"
  bm_falmer_calia_desc:0 "High above the frozen seaside cliffs of Northwatch, where the sea crashes below and the wind sings old stories to the crags, Lady #bold Calia#! stands watch. She stands as one of the last great Falmeri nobles of the northern shores— a ruler whose legend predates most of the glaciers within her realm.\n\nAmong the Snow Elven nobility, her noble house is considered to be the most unconventional. Known for its uncanny traditions, a way of life more in tune with nature than court. They rarely take part in the politics of the greater realm, preferring singing over scheming and the howl of the wind over the clamor of court. \n\nYet, for all its oddities, it is within this strange and storied house that the realm’s most open-minded elves resides. Lady Callia is very tolerant of other races and cultures. She has encouraged her offspring and citizens to engage kindly with others, for she firmly believe that peace is found where understanding takes root.\n\nFor many years, there was accord between the elves and the men of the Karth. While the men of the river kept to themselves for the most part— trade flourished between them, with the elves offering their ancient wisdom in exchange for the rugged resources the men could provide.\n\nBut now, word drifts from the mountains of the east—of how her kin fell by the savage hands of men who hailed from across the Sea of Ghosts. The elves within her realm have begun to question whether they can truly place their trust in the races of men—and whether they should continue to follow the ideals that their liege holds dear.\n\n#bold Will you go against your ideals to protect the dignity of the Falmer, or will the Arch crack beneath the weight of vengeance?#!"

  bm_karth_tehma_desc:0 "Chieftess #bold Tehma#! bears the proud legacy of her father, the esteemed and gallant Nedic warrior, Tehmaic Faolige. When the Atmorans called for aid in avenging the innocents of Saarthal, her father did not hesitate to rally the Nedic tribes of the Arch to aid them. \n\nHer husband, Jorgal the Child-Skald, also stood as a mere boy among the Companions that reclaimed Saarthal. Tehma’s father, Jorgal’s family, and countless other Nedic and Atmoran warriors gave their lives in the name of justice for the fallen. \n\nThey died and bled as brothers and sisters in-arms, and in return, the Companions swore to protect all native men of Mereth who sought peace. \n\nBut now, Tehma watches with growing unease as the elves were slaughtered without mercy. Even those who took no part in the 'Night of Tears' have their blood soaking the snows.\n\nShe wonders— if the men of Karth offer refuge to the fleeing elves, will Ysgramor’s promise endure? Or will the Atmorans turn their fury upon the very people who once stood beside them in their greatest time of need?\n\n#bold Will you settle and honor the legacy of those who came before? or stand for what is just—even if it may cost you everything?#!"

  bm_orc_buzga_desc:0 "Chief #bold Kharag gro-Gurug#! is the mightiest orc you can find along the Karth river. Broad as a bear, scarred like old stone, and as unyielding as the bones of the world. His people, have long lived alongside the humans and elves, carving out peace with tusk and axe along the river valleys.\n\nFor a time, peace held. Even the Nedes of Karth came to respect the old ways. But now, tales from the east ride on the wind—of how the Snow Elves were butchered by the human invaders. Buzga listens, and something stirs beneath his iron calm. Perhaps it is time to stop asking for peace and start carving it.\n\n#bold Will you hold the Karth with patience and pride, or will fury forge a new path through the north?#!"

  bm_sea_giant_thumul_desc:0 "Far to the north, the great Sea Giant #bold Thumul#! rises from the depths. With each passing day, the sea bears sorrowful songs recounting how the bloodthirsty men mercilessly butchered countless of his land-dwelling brethren.\n\nThe merciless slaughters sparks an unrelenting fury within the Mighty Sea Giant, compelling him to drag every last wretched human soul into the darkest depths of the sea. \n\nOut of all the bloody humans he despises, none fuels his hatred greater than the overrated manbeast—the vile #bold Ysgramor#! of Atmora. \n\nThumul seeks to confront and challenge the leader of the prideful cretins in single combat. Man against Giant, Storm against the Sea, from Dusk till Dawn, until the Blood-price is paid in full.\n\nAs he tried to lure him out,  Thumul leads his forces to rain havoc upon the Northern raiders. He swears to raise a cairn of broken ships and shattered longboats in Sinmur’s honor—until the humans remember why the Giants of Nirn should never be trifled with. \n\n#bold Will you stand against the bloody Axe of Ysgramor and claim your vengeance, or fall beneath it as others did before you?#!"

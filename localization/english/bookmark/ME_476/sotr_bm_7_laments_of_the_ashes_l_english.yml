  bm_laments_of_the_ashes_desc:0 "The lands in the Northeast lies scorched and silent, where ash chokes the wind and grief clings like a second skin. The Atmorans came like a tidal fire—blazing, relentless, and merciless.\n\nLord Fanarion, last scion of a minor Falmeri house, now clings to survival in the ash-veiled isles east of his ravaged homeland. Despite his losses, He dreams not of vengeance, but of preserving the fragile remnants of his kin. Meanwhile, Captain Rhorlak of the Chrion has carved his name in stone and blood. The Redoran capital of Blacklight burns beneath his banners—its defenders slaughtered, its honor drowned in crimson.\n\nYet from the battered keep of Kogomar rises Lord Saryon Redoran, swearing to reclaim his ancestral lands and avenge the kin stolen from him. High amid the scorched cinders of Vvardenfell, Lady Moresa Dagoth walks gracefully, listening to whispers from the west. Calculating her next move, in an effort to see what’s best for her family & House.\n\nIn the ashlands below, the tribes of the Ahemmusa chant laments older than memory. And deep within the forgotten caverns at the feet of the Red Mountain, Lord Suvis of Clan Berne sharpens his fangs in the dark.\n\n#bold Will you silence the cries of the ashes—or become one of the many souls they mourn?#"

  bm_ashlander_ahemmusa_desc:0 "Long after the fall of the High Velothi Culture, the Ashlanders endure, their way of life unbroken since the days Veloth the Prophet set foot in these lands. They persisted and ignore the comforts of grand civilizations to follow the true path of the Prophet.\n\nAshkan #bold Nalor#! leads the ancient Ahemmusa Tribe, who never traded their way of life for the comforts of stone cities. While the noble Chimeri houses squabble over the last glories of the dead High Velothi civilization, the true children of Veloth must continue to endure in the great ashlands. \n\n#bold Will you guide the Ahemmusa through the changing tides of the Merethic era, or be swept away with the crumbling world?#!"

  bm_atmoran_rhorlak_desc:0 "In the chaos of the Return, #bold Rhorlak#! distinguishes himself as the most brutal and relentless among the Companions. The strength and fury of the Captain of the Chrion were second only to the mighty Ysgramor himself.\n\n As a close friend to the Harbinger and a firm believer in his cause, Rhorlak believes all Mer to be liars and traitors, undeserving of mercy or trust. Rhorlak has fought tirelessly to avenge what happened to the men at Saarthal, leading his warband with his brutal and questionable methods. \n\nRhorlak and his warband continue to unleash great havoc eastward, upon the [Glossary( 'the fields of the Clouded Sun', 'RESDAYN_GLOSS' )], and no elven power has yet matched their might.\n\nEven Blacklight, once a proud elven stronghold, now smolders beneath his banners. The obsidian city streets ran red with elven blood, and those who saw him could only pray of escaping his vengeance. \n\nTo his own anger, some are said to have fled southward, hiding in their disgusting bug-huts. Yet it matters not. For wherever they hide, Rhorlak and his warband will not cease their hunt. He will continue his pursuit until all elvenkind have answered for what they did to his people. \n\n#bold Will you continue to remind all elvenkind that men are not to be lightly trifled with?—even if it means marching into the very heart of Red Mountain itself?#!"

  bm_chimer_dagoth_desc:0 "High amidst the scorched cinders atop the heights of Kogoruhn, Lady #bold Moresa Dagoth#! walks gracefully, her ears catching the distant cries carried by the winds from the west. The Atmoran invaders have struck down the Redorans and carved their way across the land. Their victory echoes through the ashes, stirring unrest even in the heart of Vvardenfell. \n\nYet, even as the shadows loom ever closer, Lady Moresa faces a different kind of challenge—her squabbling heirs. Each one has long been vying for their claim to power, driven by their own burning ambitions and a relentless desire to fulfill their grand aspirations.\n\nLady Moresa calculates each of her move with precision, ever aware that her next choice could tip the scales in her favor — or plunge her house into further turmoil.\n\n#bold In a time of shifting powers and internal strife, will you steer your family through the storm, or will the whispers of the wind bring ruin to House Dagoth?#!"

  bm_chimer_redoran_desc:0 "House Redoran now lies under the ashes. Their proud capital of Blacklight now smolders in ruin, consumed by the fires of Atmoran invaders. Only a handful of survivors remain, broken and scarred. They have managed to flee down south to their remaining holdings in Kogomar. \n\nLord #bold Saryon#! has been reluctantly forced to step up to lead his house. His elder brother, the former head of the house, along with Saryon's own children and much of his bloodline, were slaughtered in the sack of Blacklight. Grief has hardened into fury, and Saryon now seeks to punish the beasts of Atmora by any means necessary. \n\nFrom the towering peaks of the Velothi Mountains, he gazes upon the other revered families, who are locked in their endless, petty discord. Amidst their ceaseless bickering, he dares to hope—hope that he might unite them in a final, desperate effort to face the Northen Barbarians. \n\nFrom the ashes of defeat, Lord Saryon rises — vowing to reclaim his ancestral lands in the name of the mighty House Redoran. \n\n#bold Will you rally the broken houses of Vvardenfell and carve a path of vengeance back to Blacklight — or will the legacy of House Redoran be extinguished forever?#!"

They are the few remaining souls whose culture, traditions, and dreams are slowly being swept into the ashes.  He and a handful of kin managed to escape the brutal slaughter at the hands of the Atmoran invaders, fleeing east across the broken seas to the ash-veiled isles beyond their ruined homeland.\n\nA humble and gentle soul amid a world of fury and ruin, Fanarion dreams not of vengeance... only of survival. His heart is set only on preserving whatever remains of his people.\n\nWith little more than hope and dwindling numbers, he clings to the traditions of his ancestors and his faith in Auri-El, seeking a new future for the Falmer in this strange new land.\n\n#bold Will you safeguard the dying embers of your kin, or will the last light of your house be snuffed out beneath the rising tide of Men? or something even worse?#!"
